<p>By Lieut.-Col. <span class="smcap">A. St. H. Gibbons</span>, F.R.G.S., F.R.C.I.,

<p>In giving his readers a very concise and reliable
description of "Germany's Vanishing Colonies,"
the author performs a useful public service. To
the travelled man who may have seen something
of these Colonies the work carries conviction; for
others it has a useful educative value. Knowledge
is essential to sound judgment, and although&mdash;thanks
to the policy of the late Paul Kruger!&mdash;a
growing interest in our great Empire has
permeated all classes in recent years, anything
like a comprehensive knowledge of the local
conditions and interests of our 12,000,000 miles
of Empire is not to be expected until our schools
and universities have added to their curriculum
systematic instruction in Imperial history and
geography.</p>

<p>This book provides important and interesting
data on which, at the close of the war, that policy
which will determine the status and ownership
of Germany's overseas possessions can be built.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
To some it may appear that the title of the book
implies the dividing of the skin before the lion is
killed. Be that as it may; to those who have
never felt misgivings as to the ultimate result of
this life-and-death struggle for Empire, the speculative
element is overshadowed by the supreme
importance of inspiring the public mind with an
accurate and intelligible grasp of the situation.
At times consciously, at others unconsciously,
democratic Governments reflect the mind of the
community. In due course, our statesmen, working
in concert with the Dominion Governments,
will be called upon to decide, in the name of the
Empire, how far it is politic, either for strategic
or economic purposes, to annex all or part of
such German oversea possessions as the Allies
in council shall decide to be within the British
sphere of influence. Let the people in private and
public discussion, and through the medium of
the Press, come to something like an unanimous
decision (and this volume should help them to do
so), and so strengthen the hands of the Government
when the crucial hour arrives.</p>

<p>No doubt every aspect will be taken into consideration.
It will be noted that from the moment
Germany decided to establish a colonial Empire
her envious hatred of Great Britain took root. She
realised that at the British Empire's expense alone
could she fully develop her ideal. This feeling
has grown and intensified until, in recent years,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
she had barely cloaked her ambitious design to
replace us as a world Power. When the final
word is spoken, and compensation for loss in life
and treasure is forced on us by her unscrupulous
action is discussed, it will, I think, be ruled
that we are more than justified in absorbing, as
part payment, those possessions which she had
designed to expand at the expense of ours.</p>

<p>Again, British and French Foreign Office
dispatches, at the outbreak of war and subsequently,
go to show that German diplomacy has
been deeply tinged with covetousness and that
special kind of hatred born of envy; that she has
brushed aside all honourable and humanitarian
considerations, and ignored that international
code to which she herself had set her seal in favour
of a ruthless and unscrupulous application of the
principle of brute force. Nor in this case can
she offer the "first offenders'" plea. Before the
Bar of History she is confronted by Mary Therese
and Francis Joseph of Austria, by the quondam
Kingdom of Poland, by Denmark and France.
Each and all give evidence of forced war as a
step towards Prussian expansion.</p>

<p>Can a nation so deeply impregnated with such
principles since its cradle days so far reform its
political methods as to give reasonable assurance
that in thirty or forty years hence she will not
reintroduce into the life of nations that spirit
and practice of mediaeval barbarism (now better
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
known as "<i>kultur</i>") which at present racks the
civilised world? We may leave it to the Ethiopian
and the leopard may reply.</p>

<p>Popular opinion at present seems to indicate
an almost unanimous opinion that the roar of the
last cannon will ring down the curtain on the
German Empire of to-day. That Prussia's Polish
province and Alsace-Lorraine will cease to be
German may be assumed. Should Denmark
recover Schleswig-Holstein, should Hanover regain
her independence, and Bavaria repudiate
Prussia's uncongenial overlordship it would&mdash;in
the event of a non-annexation policy being
adopted&mdash;be difficult to decide to whom the
present German Colonies belong&mdash;this, of course,
irrespective of conquests which have been or may
be effected in the meantime, and which, in accordance
with the German theory that "might is
right," will, <i>ipso facto</i>, have been transferred to
the Allies with a "clean title."</p>

<p>History serves to show that to annex territory
carrying a considerable homogeneous and hostile
population is seldom a success, but since the
German Colonies are so sparsely settled&mdash;partly
because her bureaucratic methods discourage
immigration, and partly because she has no
difficulty in absorbing her surplus population at
home&mdash;this argument does not apply here.
Closely linked with this is the native question.
Personal observation, supported by first-hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
information, serves to show that German treatment
of indigenous populations is just what might
be expected. To the Englishman, discipline
implies leadership&mdash;to the German, the mere
forcing of will, without consideration for their
feelings or personal interests, on subordinates. It
serves to crush out individuality and self-respect.
It is the discipline of "push." Those who have
travelled in Germany will have noticed how this
spirit permeates all ranks and classes. That its
application becomes more intense in dealing with
inferior races, where the restraints of civilisation
do not exist, will surprise no one. In the Pacific
Islands, as in their African Colonies, the same tale
is told. Their native population would rejoice to
exchange German for British rule.</p>

<p>If, then, we are to save the next generation from
a second great European upheaval, and if we
desire to emancipate those native races at present
under German control from a system of harsh and
selfish exploitation, Germany in Europe must, by
the elimination of provinces detached from neighbouring
states by previous wars of aggression, be
deprived of the power she has so notoriously
abused, and if we are to do our obvious duty by
the native races, her Colonies must pass to other
hands.</p>

COLONIES</p>


<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">GERMANY AND HER COLONIAL EXPANSION</span></h2>


<p>The German Empire of to-day may best be
described as an enlarged and aggrandised Prussia;
its people imbued with Prussian ideals and drawing
their aspirations from the fountain of Prussia.</p>

<p>In the Confederation of the German States
as constituted in 1814, Prussia, under the
Hohenzollern Dynasty, was always the turbulent
and disturbing element, by methods peculiarly
Prussian, working towards a unity of the German
states&mdash;a comity of nations welded into one under
the hegemony of Prussia.</p>

<p>It was not long before Prussian domination
became irksome, and her provocative and arrogant
attitude created a war with Denmark in 1864 and
with Austria in 1866&mdash;the latter, a struggle between
Hohenzollern and Hapsburg, culminating in the
complete discomfiture of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The war with Denmark gave Germany the
harbour of Kiel, together with the million inhabitants
of Schleswig-Holstein, and Prussia emerged
from the struggle with Austria the leading Power
in the new North German Confederation.</p>

<p>Since then the salt of Prussian militarism has
been ploughed into the fertile German fields which
produced some of the master-minds in the worlds
of Thought, Philosophy and Literature.</p>

<p>In accord with true Prussian methods France
was forced into a declaration of war in 1870, with
the result that the German octopus settled its
tentacles upon the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine,
an area of 5,605 square miles, with 1,500,000
inhabitants.</p>

<p>A new phase of Empire was then created, and
the Germany of to-day was constituted as practically
a new nation under the rule of William of
Hohenzollern, who was elected the "Deutscher
Kaiser," or German Emperor, at Versailles on
18th January, 1871.</p>

<p>Prince Otto von Bismarck became the first
Chancellor of the new German Empire, and in his
hands the fortunes of the House of Hohenzollern
prospered, as he set himself to his fixed and single-minded
purpose&mdash;that was, to elevate Prussia to
the foremost place amongst the continental Powers.</p>

<p>Bismarck's policy was directed towards extension,
but it was extension of Prussia (or Germany)
in Europe and the consolidation of the portions
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
added to the German Empire. In 1871 he declared
"Germany does not want Colonies." He refused
to embark upon dazzling adventures in which the
risk stirred the imagination, and when an agitation
arose in favour of making Germany a sea Power,
he confronted it with the words of Frederick the
Great: "All far-off acquisitions are a burden to the
State." This view he held until the last decade of
his career.</p>

<p>Bismarck looked forward, however, to the germanisation
of the Low Countries, the absorption
of which Cecil Rhodes declared to the German
Emperor he believed to be the destiny of Germany.</p>

<p>The spirit of Prussia was even instilled into
Austria, and Prussian example was emulated by
the House of Hapsburg.</p>

<p>As Prussia set herself to the repression of
Danish nationality in Schleswig-Holstein and of
French in Alsace-Lorraine, so Austria adopted a
policy of eradicating national traits in Hungary.</p>

<p>The national unity aimed at by Bismarck having
been established, Germany continued to thrive and
grow during the peaceful years following 1871;
and the development of the trade of this infant
amongst nations is a world's phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yet as with Prussia in the past, so with the
greater Germany of to-day, history is a tale of one
persistent struggle for possessions.</p>

<p>As is natural during times of peace, the population
of Germany increased at an enormous rate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
growing from 35,500,000 in 1850 to 66,000,000 in
1912&mdash;an average of about 615,000 per annum&mdash;while
the present increase is roughly 900,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>Between the years 1881 and 1890 German emigration
amounted to 130,000 annually; but it was only
18,500 in 1913, and this was more than counterbalanced
by immigration from Austria, Russia,
and Italy.</p>

<p>Over-population soon became a pressing question,
and the obvious remedy was expansion of
frontiers or new territories for the accommodation
of the surplus.</p>

<p>German policy in a very few years became
directed towards extension of territories, for it was
apparent that emigration to foreign countries and
dependencies only strengthened other nations.</p>

<p>An outlet for the surplus population was
required; but in view of the need for men to feed
the military machine which had founded the German
Empire and upon which its strength depended,
it was clear that emigration to foreign countries
and dependencies was an inexpedient measure of
relief, as it would be applied at the expense of the
mother country.</p>

<p>In the year 1882 the German Colonisation Society
was started, with the object of acquiring Colonies
oversea and the establishment of a navy and mercantile
marine to form the link binding the isolated
territories to the motherland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The society was formed by merchants and traders
with the end in view of extending trade; but to the
militarist section the idea of Imperial expansion
presented itself, and to that party the Colonies
appealed rather from a strategical than a commercial
standpoint.</p>

<p>The society received enthusiastic support, and,
indeed, all Germany began to look to Colonies
which were to be purely German; and with this
enlarged horizon, policy settled down to the acquisition
of oversea territory, the ambition being
naturally accompanied by an aspiration towards
a powerful navy, necessary, ostensibly, to keep
communications open.</p>

<p>The German Emperor held very determined
ideas on the subject of expansion, but the Chancellor,
Bismarck, altered his views only so far as
to approve of the founding of Trade Colonies under
Imperial Protection.</p>

<p>Bismarck was loth to weaken his military
machine by the emigration of men; and the German
ideal of colonisation was not, therefore, a policy of
settlement but one of commercial exploitation; inasmuch
as Germany's aim was to develop home
industries in order to keep in employment at
home the men who formed the material of her
armour.</p>

<p>Germans were required to remain Germans; and
this object it was hoped to attain by settlements
in German Colonies, where compact centres of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
German <i>kultur</i> could be established to teach the
art of order to the remaining peopled kingdoms.</p>

<p>The German view being that the British oversea
Empire was acquired "by treachery, violence
and fomenting strife," one cannot imagine,
especially with her Prussian traditions, a violent
disturbance of the "good German conscience" in
contemplating means of attaining an object.</p>

<p>In the first Prussian Parliament Bismarck thundered
out "Let all questions to the King's
Ministers be answered by a roll of drums," and,
in sneering at the ballot as "a mere dice-box,"
he declared: "It is not by speechifying and
majorities that the great questions of the day will
have to be decided, but by <i>blood and iron</i>."</p>

<p>Prussia had fought for and won her predominance;
her greatness was acquired by the sword;
and the Bismarck cult has prevailed in that no other
means of expansion and nationalisation than by
conquest presents itself to the German mind. All
negotiations with foreign nations, therefore, have
been conducted to the accompaniment of the rattle
of the sword in the scabbard.</p>

<p>Speaking of Colonies in his recent bombastic
book, General von Bernhardi said: "The great
Elector laid the foundation of Prussia's power by
successful and deliberately planned wars"; and
in justifying the right to make war he says: "It
may be that a growing people cannot win Colonies
from uncivilised races, and yet the State wishes
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to retain the surplus population which the mother
country can no longer feed. Then the only course
left is to acquire the necessary territory by war."</p>

<p>Germany now proposed to tread the same path
as England, but she had arrived late in the day
and the methods whereby she purposed making
up for lost time were not the methods whereby
England had established herself.</p>

<p>Behind German colonisation lies no record of
great accomplishments inspired by lofty ideals and
high aspirations, carried into effect by noble self-sacrifice
on the part of her sons; the history conjures
up no pageant of romantic emprise nor vista
of perilous undertakings in unexplored parts of
the globe by the spirits of daring and adventure;
it holds no pulse-stirring stories of the blazing of
new trails; and scattered over its pages we do not
find imprints of the steps of pioneers of true civilisation,
nor are its leaves earmarked with splendid
memories.</p>

<p>Where England gave of the best of her manhood
to establish in daughter states in the four quarters
of the globe her ideals of freedom, justice, and fair
commerce&mdash;that manhood whose inspiration and
incentive was their country's honour, but whose
guerdon was in many a case a lonely grave or
a more imposing monument in the "sun-washed
spaces"&mdash;the ambassadors of German <i>kultur</i> followed
upon a beaten track to seize at the opportune
moment the material benefit of the crop where
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the others had ploughed with the expenditure of
their physical energy, sown with the seeds of their
intellect, and fertilised with their blood.</p>

<p>Casting about between 1882 and 1884 for territory
over which to hoist her flag, Germany found that
nearly the whole of the world was occupied; and
direct action of conquest not being expedient, Germans
were busy seeking to accomplish their aims
by secret methods of intrigue, always accompanied
by deprecation of the infringement of the vested
rights of others.</p>

<p>Active steps for the acquisition of territory began
to be taken in 1884.</p>

<p>Under pretext of being interested in the suppression
of the slave trade, Germany concerned herself
in the affairs of Zanzibar, long subject to the
influence of the Portuguese and British; but
Germany later abandoned her ambitions in the
island on the cession of Heligoland.</p>

<p>Africa was the one continent which had not
been partitioned, and Germany's quest of territory
brought about the "scramble for Africa."</p>

<p>Germany had annexed portions of the west coast
(Togoland and Kamerun), and the vacillating
policy of the British Government during 1882-1883
enabled the Germans to annex an enormous
tract of territory north of the Orange River,
which became known as German South West
Africa.</p>

<p>Altogether the German Colonies in Africa
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
acquired in 1884 amounted to over 1,000,000 square
miles.</p>

<p>By what is known as the "Caprivi Treaty" of
the 1st July, 1890, Great Britain and Germany
agreed as to their respective "spheres of influence"
in Africa.</p>

<p>Great Britain assumed protection over the Island
of Zanzibar, and ceded to Germany in exchange
the Island of Heligoland.</p>

<p>This exchange was regarded in Germany generally
as a most disadvantageous one; but the possession
of Heligoland as a fortress was of inestimable
value to Germany&mdash;making possible the Borkum-Wilhelmshaven-Heligoland-Brunsb&uuml;ttel
naval
position, and the German militarist section craved
it in order to forestall France.</p>

<p>The territory of the Sultan of Zanzibar on the
mainland of Africa was ceded to Germany, with the
harbour of Dar-es-Salaam; and the boundaries were
so delimited as to include in German East Africa
the mountain of Kilima 'Njaro, the German
Emperor being supposed to have expressed a wish
to possess the highest mountain in Africa as a
mere matter of sentiment.</p>

<p>The Caprivi Treaty also defined the boundaries
of South West Africa.</p>

<p>In 1884 Germany had also busied herself in the
Pacific, and had hoisted her flag on several islands
as well as in North New Guinea, where the Australasian
Colonies had established settlements and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
vainly urged annexation on the British Government.</p>

<p>In 1885 the sum of 180,000 marks was voted by
the Reichstag "for the protection" of these new
German Colonies.</p>

<p>The opening of 1891 saw Germany with ample
territory oversea to accommodate surplus population;
while we, secure in our own strength, with
amused tolerance, allowed her to climb to "her
place in the sun."</p>

<p>It was not the intention of Germany, however,
to use the Colonies as dumping grounds, nor to
encourage a policy of emigration&mdash;but rather to
exploit them as supports for home industry.</p>

<p>Many German industries depend upon foreign
countries for the import of a continual supply of raw
material which cannot be produced in Germany;
while part of their necessaries are even obtained
from abroad. They also depend to a considerable
extent upon foreign countries for the sale of manufactures.</p>

<p>Their prosperity depends upon import and export
trade; for while the home industries provide work
for masses of the population, all the products cannot
be consumed at home and markets have to be found
elsewhere if employment is to continue.</p>

<p>It can never be said to be an economic interest
to encourage the establishment of industries in
Colonies&mdash;at least not manufactories of articles
made at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The establishment of such may be of interest to
provide work for those who emigrate; but from the
point of view of countries like Germany, whose
existence depends on keeping their men at home,
it is far preferable to develop every possible industry
at home, and retain the Colonies only as markets
and producers of raw material.</p>

<p>This Germany proceeded to do. Developing
Colonial trade, she extended her home industries.
During eight years her Colonial trade rose from
scarcely &pound;5,000,000 to &pound;12,000,000, and the effect
of the acquisition of Colonies upon her home industries
is marked in the fact that she employed
in those industries 11,300,000 men in 1907 as
against 6,400,000 in 1882.</p>

<p>Germany, moreover, protects even her agriculture
against the competition of her own Colonies&mdash;shutting
out their meat and their grain.</p>

<p>Germany's conception of the idea of Colonies,
therefore, was to build up overseas a new Germany
composed of daughter states, which would remain
essentially German and be the means of keeping
her men at home in remunerative employment by
providing raw material for the development of her
industries.</p>

<p>A continental nation, surrounded by powerful
neighbours, it seemed in her case a suicidal policy
to scatter her population abroad; and therefore
she exploited her Colonies in such a way as to help
her to concentrate her people at home, where she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
required men in time of peace for economic development
and in time of war for defence&mdash;and offence.</p>

<p>As a natural sequence to the responsibility of
oversea dominions, it becomes a question of life
and death to keep open the oversea commerce protected
by a powerful navy; and this point was
strongly urged by the National Party which,
advocating colonisation, arose in Germany in
1892.</p>

<p>But with the growth of Germany's oversea trade
and her navy, a new and splendid vista unfolded
itself&mdash;no less than Germany, from her place in the
sun, mistress of the world.</p>

<p>To quote von Bernhardi: "The German nation,
from the standpoint of its importance to civilisation,
is fully entitled not only to demand a place in
the sun, but to aspire to an adequate share in the
sovereignty of the world far beyond the limits of
its present sphere of influence."</p>

<p>Von Treitschke, the neurotic German historian
and poet, again "incessantly points his nation
towards the war with England, to the destruction
of England's supremacy at sea as the means by
which Germany is to burst into that path of glory
and of world dominion."<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"Treitschke dreamed of a greater Germany to
come into being after England had been crushed
on the sea."<a id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain their object no other means presented
itself than the Prussian militarist method.</p>

<p>Bismarck's object&mdash;the goal towards which he
strove, to so amply secure the position in Europe
that it could never be questioned&mdash;seemed to have
been attained by the machine of militarism, the
huge army created and kept in being by national
self-sacrifice. So to obtain what was now aimed
at, the instrument was to be an invincible fleet which
would in defiance of everyone keep sea communications
open.</p>

<p>As early as 1896 the "world Power" idea had
evolved, and at the celebration in that year of the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the
German Empire, the Emperor termed it a "world
Empire."</p>

<p>On the question of the rights of others the
German Emperor was at all events satisfied, for he
announced to the German Socialists: "We Hohenzollerns
take our crown from God alone, and to
God alone we are responsible," which leaves
nothing more to be said on that point.</p>

<p>To German minds the domination of the world
was a very real ambition and quite in accord with
the best Prussian traditions.</p>

<p>In 1905 the German Emperor visited Tangier to
impress upon a cynical brother Emperor the right
to a place in Moroccan affairs; while in 1911
German diplomacy asserted that Germany was
anxious to preserve the independence and integrity
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of Morocco because of her important interests in
the country. As a matter of fact, German trade
had steadily lost ground in Morocco and "in 1909
was exactly equal to 1/1500th or one-fifteenth part of
one single per cent of her whole foreign trade."<a id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Anent the Agadir crisis in 1911, Von Bernhardi
naively admits that it was "only the fear of the
intervention of England that deterred us from
claiming a sphere of interests of our own in
Morocco."</p>

<p>The "sphere of interests" in Morocco consisted
in coveting Agadir, the best harbour on the Atlantic
coast of Morocco, which would have been of enormous
importance to Germany and her Colonies
because ordinarily the German fleet would be tied
to the North Sea for want of coaling stations.</p>

<p>During Great Britain's time of stress with the
South African Republics, in the same way Baron
Marshall von Bieberstein declared officially that
"the continued independence of the Boer Republics
was a German interest."</p>

<p>The interest of Germany, apart from the undoubted
hope of making the Republics German
Colonies, it might simply be remarked, was that
Germany had in contemplation the construction of
a railway line from Pretoria to Santa Lucia Bay on
the east coast, 800 miles nearer Europe than the
port of Cape Town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>German history holds no record of the integrity
or independence of her neighbours being either of
German interest or concern, and her attitude is in
accord with her principle of concealing her real
intention by adopting a spirit of deprecation.</p>

<p>This is amply exemplified in the German
Emperor's letter to Lord Tweedmouth of 14th
February, 1908, stigmatising as "nonsensical and
untrue" the idea that the German fleet was being
built for any other purpose "than her needs in
relation with her rapidly growing trade."</p>

<p>The real obstacle to realisation of the great
German dream was British naval supremacy; and
all German thought and energy was devoted to the
construction of a navy strong enough to challenge
that supremacy. When she could do that it was
within the bounds of possibility that Germany
would indeed be <i>the</i> world Power.</p>

<p>Roughly, the German Colonial Empire is five
times as big as Germany, with a population of
about 14,000,000 natives; and the question of
German Colonial policy is a question of native
policy.</p>

<p>It is in Germany's interest that the natives should
be as numerous as possible, for it is their labour,
intelligence, and industry that makes the Colonial
Empire useful and necessary to Germany.</p>

<p>Individual settlers are not encouraged to
emigrate, but the plantations, ranches, etc., whence
Germany drew her supplies of raw material such
as cotton, rubber, wool, etc., are developed by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
chartered companies and trading firms, and the
so-called settlers are the managers of these.</p>

<p>Independent German farmers in her Colonies are
few and far between, and the settlements which
were to be centres of German <i>kultur</i> have not
eventuated. A new Germany has not been created
oversea.</p>

<p>There was, moreover, no room in German
Colonial expansion for individualism, which has
proved such a strength to England but was
suppressed in Germany. The individual German
is not given scope but subordinated to a system.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that Germany had not got
the class of men she required for her scheme of
Colonial development&mdash;or exploitation seems the
better word.</p>

<p>Germany's requirements were lands for growing
raw material by native labour, and markets from
which she could not be excluded&mdash;and she thought
she had found them in her Colonies.</p>

<p>The Colonies cried out for European enterprise
and European capital, but they did not want individual
settlers.</p>

<p>Under British rule the German has proved a most
desirable Colonist, but he has never thriven under
his own Colonial administration.</p>

<p>He is by nature extremely assimilative, and in
our Colonies he prospers, not only competing with
but outstripping the British trader owing to the
employment of undercutting methods which do not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
so readily occur to the British mind, hampered as
it usually is by a sense of fair play.</p>

<p>In the eastern province of the Colony of the
Cape of Good Hope, the members of the German
Legion who settled after disbandment about
King William's Town, Hanover, Stutterheim,
etc., have developed into prosperous farmers and
merchants.</p>

<p>A sandy waste in the neighbourhood of Cape
Town, once thought to be worthless, was subdivided
and taken up almost entirely by Germans, and they
have turned the land into one of the most productive
portions of the Cape Peninsula.</p>

<p>In America the German immigrants have
readily assimilated, though in Brazil they have
formed separate centres.</p>

<p>In the German Colonies a set-back to development
has been the fact that they have never realised
the importance of respecting local manners and
customs, but the home machinery has been applied
in every particular to conditions wholly dissimilar
and unsuitable.</p>

<p>In South West Africa, for instance, Dr B&ouml;nn
of Munich says they "solved the native problem
by smashing tribal life."</p>

<p>Being trained and accustomed to obey, moreover,
the German cannot act without orders, and
lacks initiative and therefore administrative ability.</p>

<p>Compulsory military service has been instituted,
and the German Colonial administration is cordially
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
detested except where perhaps it favours ill-treatment
and oppression of natives.</p>

<p>Where the British have evolved a system of
government which is a comity of commonwealths
within a monarchy, and hold their dependencies
by the sense of honour and appreciation, to which
the attitude of South Africa bears splendid witness,
the German's grip was by the claws of militarism
and terrorism.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it is perhaps not surprising
that the Germans should fall into the error
that the British dependencies would embrace an
opportunity of "throwing off the British yoke";
and the assumed disloyalty of British Colonies,
with the further assumption, widely distributed,
that various peoples under the British flag were
capable of being tampered with easily, may well
have been one of the most cogent theories leading
the German Emperor and his advisers to their
fateful decision.</p>

<p>With the extraordinary aptitude of the Germans
for intrigue, perhaps the war Lords were not altogether
foolish in their conclusions.</p>

<p>There was a chance of seduction, especially with
native races in Africa, but it was a very small
chance, and, like many another well-laid scheme,
this one failed because its authors did not understand
the material which was to be used to work it.</p>

<p>It failed in Africa because the African is more
than the beast of burden the German Colonists
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
schooled and deluded themselves into thinking.
They did not understand the native; and, in a
word, the native hates the German, especially the
officials.</p>

<p>Their methods of colonisation have good points
in matter of detail, routine work, etc.; but if
colonisation be regarded as something more than
the exploitation of a subject race and the passive
holding of its territory, they must be written down
a failure, for the extraordinary efficiency of the
administrative machinery falls far short of compensating
for the rottenness of the policy behind it.</p>

<p class="pmb3">A nation in whom a much-vaunted <i>kultur</i> has
produced an ideal of national life whose highest
expression is the atmosphere of a penal settlement,
is foredoomed to failure as a coloniser.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">SOUTH WEST AFRICA</span></h2>


<p>Ever since her acquisition of the Colony of the
Cape of Good Hope, vitally important to her in
view of her interests in the East, Great Britain had
been unquestionably the supreme Power in the
south of the African Continent.</p>

<p>With the passing of the Dutch East India Company,
Holland had ceased to be a South African
Power; while the Portuguese had lost their status.
The latter in reality only held an area along the
coast of her possessions, a great proportion of the
interior, which undoubtedly had once been beneficially
occupied by Portuguese, having reverted to
savagedom.</p>

<p>The southern point of Portuguese South East
Africa extended to and included Delagoa Bay and
Louren&ccedil;o Marquez, while the southern boundary of
their western Colony was about the 22&deg; S.</p>

<p class="pmb3">From the days of its earliest history the Cape
Colony was subject to attacks by natives, and the
constant raids by hordes of Kafirs caused the
Colony to extend its borders and absorb and settle
the Hinterland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to 1883 the natural course of beneficial occupation
and development had been towards the east
and north-east borders, over the more fertile and
naturally resourceful portions of the country, rather
than west and north-west, where a comparatively
arid zone intervened.</p>

<p>Towards the Orange and Vaal Rivers the hardiest
race of pioneers the world has ever seen,
the "Voor-trekking" Boers, pressed onwards to
escape from subjection to any form of government
excepting their own patriarchal control. Their
story hardly comes within the scope of this modest
work; but it is indissolubly connected with the
making of South Africa, and a brief sketch of their
history may be permissible.</p>

<p>The exodus of the Boers, who were composed of
farmers of not only Dutch but French and English
origin, commenced with the Great Trek of 1836,
and they spread out ever seeking freedom from
restraint. They came into collision with the Zulus
under Dingaan, by whom a number of them were
treacherously massacred, but whom they finally
severely defeated and Dingaan fled.</p>

<p>Dissensions arose amongst the Boers shortly
after, and a number trekked on and established a
separate settlement, with Potchefstroom as capital.
Those who remained occupied Natal and established
a Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, however, they did not find peace, for Sir
George Napier, in command of the British forces
at the Cape, dispatched a contingent to drive them
out. This contingent the Boers nearly annihilated.</p>

<p>A settler, Dick King, then made his memorable
ride from Durban to Grahamstown, covering the
distance of 375 miles in nine days, and reinforcements
were sent up.</p>

<p>Natal was, in 1843, declared to be a British
Colony, with the result that a fresh exodus of Boers
occurred across the Drakensberg Mountains into
Griqualand.</p>

<p>For forty years the Boers wandered, but wherever
they tried to settle they were pressed on&mdash;being
continually told that they could not shake off their
allegiance, although no step was taken to reclaim
them or the country they won.</p>

<p>So far from receiving protection from the Cape
Government, the latter even armed the Griquas
against the Boers, and sent a military force to
the assistance of the natives. And so they were
harried until they were allowed to establish their
Republics of the Transvaal and Free State, until
overtaken by the destiny which Providence had
marked out for them.</p>

<p>In 1881 an attempt was made by Great Britain
to annex the Transvaal, but after General Colley's
defeat and death at Majuba the independence of the
Transvaal was acknowledged under British suzerainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The western border of the Transvaal Republic
marched on Bechuanaland and the Kalahari Desert,
and in 1882 the Transvaal completed a convention
with the Portuguese Government under which the
former was granted a concession to build a railway
from the capital, Pretoria, to Delagoa Bay on the
east coast.</p>

<p>The delimited boundary of the Cape Colony was
the Orange River, but as early as 1793 a Dutch
expedition from the Cape took possession of Walfisch
Bay, Angra Pequena, as well as Possession,
Ichaboe, and other islands on the south-west coast
in the name of the Dutch East India Company,
while Namaqualand and Damaraland had been
traversed from end to end by British and Dutch
traders and explorers.</p>

<p>British statesmen, however, neglected the south-west,
though the islands were annexed at different
times between 1861 and 1867, and Walfisch Bay
in 1878. In 1874 the islands were incorporated in
the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>The mainland on the south-west, however, remained
an open field as far as actual occupation
went, in spite of its being tacitly acknowledged a
British "sphere of influence."</p>

<p>Until the "scramble for Africa" no one would
have regarded with anything but ridicule the idea
that an enormous tract of country, comprising Great
Namaqualand and Damaraland, would have been
lost to Great Britain; yet British statesmen at home,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
feeling secure in the country's position, refused
to encourage anything but a policy of gradual
absorption.</p>

<p>In 1867 the Home Government was strongly
urged by the Government of the Cape to annex
Great Namaqualand and Damaraland, but declined
to undertake the responsibility.</p>

<p>In the following year the residents of the territory,
including numerous German missionaries,
urged that the country might be declared British
and be subject to British administration; but the
proposal was met with disfavour.</p>

<p>In the year 1877 that great-minded Imperialist,
Sir Bartle Frere, then Governor of the Cape of
Good Hope, advised by the Executive Council at
the Cape, made a strong recommendation that as a
first step an Order in Council should be passed, empowering
the Cape Parliament to legislate for the
purpose of annexing the coast up to the Portuguese
boundary; and that in the meanwhile no time
should be lost in hoisting the British flag at
Walfisch Bay. This latter step was assented to,
and it was shortly afterwards carried into effect;
but Sir Bartle Frere's larger proposals were
negatived.</p>

<p>Sir Bartle Frere subsequently renewed his representations
on the subject, but the Imperial Government
continued of opinion that no action should be
taken.<a id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The British Imperial Government was satisfied
that there could be no possible danger in delay,
and were disturbed at the unsettled state of the
native territories of the Cape Colony and the
recurrence of native disturbances which have
been a prevailing element in the existence of
the Colony.</p>

<p>The Imperial Government finally decided that it
was unnecessary to extend their possessions beyond
the then boundaries, that the Orange River should
be maintained as the north-western boundary of the
Cape Colony, and that the Government would give
no encouragement to schemes for the extension of
British jurisdiction over Great Namaqualand and
Damaraland.</p>

<p>Up to 1883 the only assent to petitions from the
Cape Government, from residents in Great Namaqualand
and Damaraland, and from the natives of
those territories, was for the annexation of the
islands off the coast, and of Walfisch Bay and a
very small portion of the country immediately
surrounding it.</p>

<p>The danger of Germany stepping in was never
disturbing to the minds of the British statesmen,
and they were merely concerned with weighing the
advantages of embracing the occasion.</p>

<p>German diplomacy had, however, been at work
in its insidious way; and although active operations
under Bismarck's policy of forming "Trade
Colonies" were not undertaken by the German
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Government until well into 1884, the promoters and
originators of the German Colonisation Society had
been busy ever since the first conception of the
Colonial idea in Germany.</p>

<p>During the years preceding 1884, indeed, representatives
of the Bremen and Hamburg merchants
had made many not unsuccessful efforts to worm
themselves into the trading centres in Southern
Africa.</p>

<p>Ambassadors of German commerce set out as
pioneers of the new movement, and as early as
August, 1883, the <i>Standard</i> newspaper published
a communication from its special correspondent in
Berlin&mdash;headed "The First German Colony"&mdash;reporting
that a Bremen firm had "acquired" the
Bay of Angra Pequena (Luderitzbucht) on the
south-west coast of Africa.</p>

<p>The article proceeds that "the German Press,
which was disappointed by the Reichstag last year
(<i>re</i> the Samoa Bill), expresses great satisfaction at
the consent of the German Government to protect
the infant Colony and to allow the German flag to
be hoisted over it. The semi-official <i>Post</i> declares
that this is the most practicable kind of colonisation,
because it avoids international difficulties. In
spite of the statement ... that the German Government
avoids giving any encouragement to immigration,
the <i>Post</i> is convinced that if Germans will
promote the increase of German manufacturing
industry by founding commercial Colonies, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
will not lack the powerful protection of the Imperial
Government."</p>

<p>There the whole of Bismarck's ex-territorial
policy lies in a nutshell: the continued expansion
of Germany from within by means of trade with
purely German dominions.</p>

<p>Beyond this the German Government expressed
no intention of actually annexing territory, though
it was a straw which showed very clearly the direction
in which the wind set.</p>

<p>It was an inexpedient policy for the Government
to proceed to declaring Protectorates over areas not
in actual occupation by other Powers yet coming
within their "spheres of influence," and the subterfuge
resorted to was the establishment of trade
centres by merchants who would claim the protection
of the German flag; albeit it could not be
seriously argued that the mere foundation of a
trading station could constitute territorial acquisition
in any part of the world where Germany as a
Power had not the least claim.</p>

<p>For many years there had in Germany been
advocates of colonisation schemes with a considerably
wider horizon, who had formulated ideas of
expansion and pressed their views upon the German
Government and public. Foremost amongst these
was Herr Ernst von Weber, and the enunciation
of his higher ambitions for his country, in a remarkable
article published in 1879, not only attracted
considerable attention in South Africa but induced
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Sir Bartle Frere again to draw the attention of the
Home Government to the avouched plan for a
German Colony in South Africa.</p>

<p>Herr von Weber in his article pointed to the
attractive prospect and noble ambition by which
Englishmen might be inspired to found a new
Empire in the African continent, "possibly more
valuable and more brilliant than even the Indian
Empire."</p>

<p>Von Weber argued that it was the duty of
Germany to protest against steps taken by England
to realise this ambition; urging in support that
Germans had a peculiar interest in the "Boer"
territories&mdash;"for here dwell a splendid race of
people nearly allied to us (Germans)."</p>

<p>After going into the history of the Boers, the
writer of the article states quite seriously that the
Transvaal Boers had "the most earnest longing
that the German Empire, <i>which they properly
regard as their parent and mother country</i>, should
take them under its protection."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, except in Government circles
in the coterie of continental intriguers who surrounded
and misled Paul Kruger, the German is
barely tolerated by the Boers, and <i>vervluchste
Deutscher</i> (cursed German) is as common a descriptive
as <i>verdomde Rooinek</i> (damned Englishman).<a id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, to the Boers every German is
a Jew&mdash;a gentleman, in his mind, associated with
a watch with defective parts or a "last year's ready
reckoner."</p>

<p>Next, the Boer, while proud of his ancestry,
strongly disclaims any loyalty to a European
Power; and although a Dutch dialect is in almost
universal use, he would indignantly repudiate a
suggestion that he is bound by any ties to Holland,
even after he has been fully persuaded of the actual
existence of that country.</p>

<p>The Boer trekkers, besides those of Dutch
origin, included the descendants of many noble
French families, and their numbers were supplemented
by English immigrants who were sent out
to the eastern province of the Cape Colony in 1820.
Many of these trekked with the Boers owing to
dissatisfaction at being denied political and civil
rights; and of the original 3053 immigrants who
landed in 1820, only 438 remained a few years
later, on their original grants in the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>While the Boers protested and fought against
annexation by great Britain, it was merely because
of repugnance to restraint and certainly not out of
any love for Germany.</p>

<p>After expatiating on the richness of the mineral
resources of the Transvaal, von Weber points to
the possibilities of the country if Delagoa Bay were
acquired.</p>

<p>In spite of claiming the Boers as kindred, however,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
he shows the cloven hoof by stating that
"a constant mass immigration of Germans would
gradually bring about a decided numerical preponderance
of Germans over the Dutch population,
and of itself would by degrees effect the germanisation
of the country in a peaceful manner."</p>

<p>He goes on to recommend that Germany ought
"at any price," in order to forestall England, to
get possession of points on both the west and east
coasts of Africa, where factories could be established,
branches of which, properly fortified, could
be gradually pushed farther and farther inland and
so by degrees form a wide network of German
settlements.</p>

<p>That these views were not held by Herr von
Weber alone in Germany must have been apparent
to our Foreign and Colonial Offices, but the only
steps taken were to ask the British ambassador in
Berlin for a report; and this, when received, assured
the Government that the plan had no prospect of
success, because the German Government felt more
the want of soldiers than of Colonies, and consequently
discouraged emigration&mdash;while the German
Government's disinclination to acquire distant
dependencies had been marked in the rejection of
the Samoa Bill.</p>

<p>The possibility of a reversal of feeling did not
occur to anyone apparently, and the British Government
was therefore quite satisfied that "the plan
had no prospect of success"; and having intimated
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the same to Sir Bartle Frere, abandoned interest in
the matter.</p>

<p>To the Prussian militarist section in Germany
Ernst von Weber's exhortation irresistibly appealed.
A glance at the map of South Africa
will show how feasible it was for Germany not only
to curtail the expansion of British territory from
the south, but to secure the dominion of the greater
part of the continent for Germany.</p>

<p>It was a great ideal and came near to consummation
by insidious working of German Government
agents, bountifully assisted in their object by the
vacillation and indifference of the British Colonial
and Foreign Offices.</p>

<p>In the south-west was a huge area of which no
actual annexation had been proclaimed, yet to the
mind of our statesmen amply secured by being
understood to be within the "sphere of British
influence." Between it and the Transvaal Republic
lay another unprotected area stretching across the
Kalahari so-called "desert" and including Bechuanaland,
the happy hunting-ground of missionaries
and Matabele raiders. South-east of the Transvaal,
stretching to the coast, was another unoccupied
region comprising Tongaland and part of Zululand,
with an excellent harbour on the east coast at
St Lucia Bay.</p>

<p>Give any Power Great Namaqualand and Damaraland
on the west coast, add Bechuanaland in
the interior and a working agreement with the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Transvaal Republic with access to the east coast
at St Lucia Bay, then the Cape Colony was shut
in by very circumscribed borders for ever from her
Hinterland; while a dream of "Africa all Red"
was smothered in its genesis, and its record filed
away for future reference in the archives of the
might have been.</p>

<p>But a belt across the southern portion of the
continent did not comprise the sum-total of the
Prussian ambition. There was an enormous and
fabulously rich extent of country stretching up
to and beyond the Zambezi, occupied only by
marauding savages under the rule of Lo Bengula,
King of the Amandebele&mdash;and now known as
Rhodesia.</p>

<p>With a distinct vision of the prize offering, the
German set out with the mailed fist wrapped in
cotton wool to stalk his prey delicately.</p>

<p>In 1883 while German traders were busy establishing
a footing in Great Namaqualand and
Damaraland, diplomacy and intrigue had been at
work in the Transvaal. The Boer Government
had concluded an agreement with the Portuguese
whereby they obtained an outlet to the east coast
by a railway to Delagoa Bay, and the Boers had
begun to occupy portions of Bechuanaland, separating
the Transvaal and Namaqualand.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Boer Republics were proclaimed over the territories
of several Bechuana chiefs, and overtures
were made by German emissaries from the Transvaal
to Lo Bengula for a concession over the territory
under his sway.</p>

<p>Tongaland and a portion of the Zululand coast,
including St Lucia Bay, was under the subjection
of Dinizulu, who had succeeded Cetywayo as King
of Zululand, and with him negotiations were entered
into, the ultimate end of which was to be the cession
to Germany (or the Transvaal) of a portion of the
sea-board.</p>

<p>The British Government can hardly really be
blamed for not pursuing in 1883 a vigorous policy
of annexation in Southern Africa, for in 1879 there
had been general native disturbances&mdash;including a
costly war with the Zulus, with its memorable disaster
to the British arms at Isandhlwana and the
deplorable death of Prince Victor Napoleon. In
1881 we were defeated by the Boers at Laings Nek
and Majuba, the little war ending with a retirement
quite the reverse of graceful; in 1882 Egypt was
in a foment, and although Sir Garnet Wolseley
destroyed Ahmed Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir, the Sudan
was still overrun by frenzied fanatics.</p>

<p>The dilatoriness of the Imperial Government,
however, is inexcusable in view of the importance
of the issue at stake, which was the overthrow of
British supremacy in South Africa in favour of
Germany.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, there were at the Cape
imperially minded statesmen who were fully alive
to the danger threatening Great Britain: Sir Bartle
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Frere, Cecil Rhodes, Sir Thomas Upington, and
John X. Merriman; and these continually pressed
their views upon the Home Government, while
Rhodes, who had formulated his own ideas as
to the destiny of the sub-continent, set himself to
employ his bounteous talents of mental and physical
energy to the due accomplishment of a purpose
which he made his life's aim.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had at his private command the
financial resources indispensable to the consummation
of his ideals; for if he had had to rely upon the
Home Government for that support, his ambition
stood little hope of realisation.</p>

<p>The German hope of obtaining sway over
Bechuanaland through the Boers was frustrated by
vigorous action on the part of the Cape statesmen.
Their protests, and especially the individual efforts
of Rhodes, stirred the Home Government into
saving for the Empire the territory which the freebooters
from the Transvaal had seized upon in the
name of their Republic.</p>

<p>Rhodes personally, on behalf of the Cape Government,
conducted negotiations with the Boers, but
it was not until 1885 that a successful issue was
arrived at after a show of force by the Home
Government in the expedition of Sir Charles
Warren.</p>

<p>The danger of the Cape Colony being cut off from
the north through Bechuanaland was obviated, but
a large field for German enterprise still lay open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Their attempts to acquire a footing in Matabeleland
were frustrated, and the delegates who set out
from the Transvaal in search of a concession from
Lo Bengula were unsuccessful in their mission to
secure for Germany sway over the countries that
now comprise Rhodesia.</p>

<p>For decades British private enterprise had been
busy on the coast of Great Namaqualand and
Damaraland; in fact in 1863 a British firm (De
Pass, Spence &amp; Co.) had purchased from the native
chiefs a large tract round about Angra Pequena,
and worked the huge deposits of guano on the
Ichaboe group of islands, some of which are less
than a mile off the mainland.</p>

<p>Disputes were constant up to 1884 between British
and German traders; continuous appeals were made
for British annexation of the territory from the
Orange River to the Portuguese border, but the
Government could not be induced to do anything
more towards acceding to Sir Bartle Frere's urgent
representations than to declare Walfisch Bay, with
some fifteen miles around it, to be British
territory.</p>

<p>In 1882 a German, Herr Luderitz, the representative
in South Africa of the Hamburg and Bremen
merchants who pulled the strings of the Government
through the German Colonisation Society,
established a trading station at Angra Pequena and
commenced, in accordance with the preconceived
plan of "conquest," to extend the operations of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
his business inland by founding trade stations at
suitable centres.</p>

<p>The British traders soon began to make representations
to the Cape Government owing to Luderitz
exercising rights of proprietorship over a large
portion of territory which he claimed to own by
purchase, and to his levying import duty charges
upon goods landed by other traders.</p>

<p>Another cause of complaint was that Luderitz
was importing large quantities of arms and ammunition
and supplying them to the natives by way of
barter.</p>

<p>The German wedge having been insidiously
inserted into South West Africa, the propitious
moment seemed to have arrived in 1884 for
Germany to acquire territorial possession of South
West Africa. Representations were accordingly
made by the German to the British Government,
pointing out that German subjects had substantial
interests in and about Angra Pequena in need of
protection, and inquiring whether the British were
prepared to extend protection to the German industries
and subjects north of the Orange River, which
British statesmen seemed to have stubbornly determined
should remain the boundary of the Cape
Colony.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Cape had, indeed, been
clearly and distinctly given to understand that,
except as regards Walfisch Bay, the Home Government
would lend no encouragement to the establishment
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of British jurisdiction in Great Namaqualand
and Damaraland north of the Orange River.</p>

<p>Bismarck's application to Lord Granville, therefore,
placed the latter in an awkward predicament,
inasmuch as he intimated that if Great Britain were
not agreeable to providing protection for the lives
and properties of German subjects, the German
Government would do its best to extend to it the
same measure of protection which they gave to
their subjects in other remote places.</p>

<p>Bismarck took care, however, to impress upon
the British Foreign Office that in any action the
German Government might take there was no
underlying design to establish a territorial footing
in South Africa. He disclaimed any intention
other than to obtain protection for the property of
German subjects; and this assurance was complacently
accepted as a complete reply to the representations
of the Cape statesmen.</p>

<p>The Home Government seem, at the same time,
to have understood at the beginning of 1884 that
the choice lay before them of formally annexing
South West Africa from the Orange River north
to the Portuguese border, or acquiescing in a
German annexation.</p>

<p>With almost criminal procrastination, however,
they deferred replying to the German inquiry,
deeming it necessary to communicate with the
Government of the Cape Colony and invite that
Government, in the event of South West Africa
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
being declared to be under British jurisdiction, to
undertake the responsibility and cost of the administration
of the territory.</p>

<p>Lord Granville, moreover, temporised by informing
Bismarck that the Cape Colonial Government
had certain establishments along the south-western
coasts, and that he would obtain a report from the
Cape, as it was not possible without more precise
information to form any opinion as to whether the
British authorities would have it in their power to
give the protection asked for in case of need.</p>

<p>This answer Bismarck probably expected and
welcomed, as it left him free to proceed with his
own arrangements, while the British Foreign Office
pigeonholed the subject until the matter might be
reopened.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1883, owing to representations
from British firms interested in South West
Africa as to German activity in that part, the British
Foreign Office obtained a report from their Charg&eacute;
d'Affaires in Berlin, and were again lulled into
complaisant inactivity by being assured that the
amount of "protection" intended to be afforded by
the German Government to Luderitz's "commercial
Colony" was precisely what would be granted
to any other subject of the Empire who had settled
abroad and acquired property.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, the Foreign Office was
notified, to suppose that the German Government
had any intention of establishing crown Colonies
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
or of assuming a Protectorate over a territory
acquired by a traveller or explorer.</p>

<p>In September the German inquiries of the
Foreign Office assumed a more pertinent nature,
and to the uncultured mind would carry an alarming
significance.</p>

<p>The British Foreign Office was asked "quite
unofficially" and for the private information of
the German Government, whether Great Britain
claimed suzerainty rights over Angra Pequena and
the adjacent territory; and if so, to explain upon
what grounds the claim was based.</p>

<p>This necessitated another reference to the Cape
of Good Hope; but in the meantime a party of
English traders, disgusted at the delay at home in
annexing the south-west coast, resolved to take
action on their own account, and set off for Angra
Pequena with the fixed determination&mdash;of which
they gave the Government due notice&mdash;of expelling
the Germans.</p>

<p>Instructions were immediately sent out for a gunboat
to proceed to the spot to prevent a collision
between the British and Germans, as the whole
question of jurisdiction was still the "subject of
inquiry."</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Boadicea</i> proceeded on instructions to
Angra Pequena, and her Commander was able to
report, on her return to Simon's Bay on the Cape
station, that no collision had taken place.</p>

<p>In November, 1883, the British Foreign Office
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
intimated to the German Government that a report
on South West Africa was in course of preparation,
but that while British sovereignty had not been
proclaimed excepting over Walfisch Bay and the
islands, the Government considered that any claim
to sovereignty or jurisdiction by a foreign Power
between the Portuguese border and the frontier of
the Cape Colony (the Orange River) would infringe
Great Britain's legitimate rights.</p>

<p>Early in 1884 the German Government, in a
dispatch to the British Foreign Office, pointed out
that the fact that British sovereignty had not been
proclaimed over South West Africa permitted of
doubt as to the legal claim of the British Government,
as well as to the practical application of the
same; the German Government having clearly in
mind the avowal of a fixed intention on the part of
the British Government not to extend jurisdiction
over the coast territory excepting in so far as
Walfisch Bay and the islands were concerned.</p>

<p>The dispatch argued that events had shown that
the British Government did not claim sovereignty
in the territory, but as a matter of fact the Government
had emphatically declined to assume that
responsibility.</p>

<p>The German dispatch concluded by asking our
Government for a statement of the title upon which
any claim for sovereignty over the territory was
based, and what provision existed for securing
legal protection for German subjects in their commercial
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
enterprises and property, in order that the
German Government might be relieved of the duty
of providing direct protection for its subjects in
that territory.</p>

<p>Here, again, was a deprecation on the part of
Germany of any other ambition than to secure
protection for life and property of German subjects.</p>

<p>Lord Derby, Secretary of State for the Colonies,
was aware of the possibility of Germany assuming
jurisdiction over Angra Pequena in the absence
of an assurance that the British Government was
prepared to undertake the protection of German
subjects; but the British Government shrank from
the idea of annexing the territory, and endeavoured
to saddle the Cape Government with the responsibility
of giving the undertaking asked for by
Germany.</p>

<p>The Cape Government was in no position to
assume such a responsibility, though they did not
hesitate to offer to do so as soon as a cabinet meeting
could be called to decide on the matter&mdash;but
when it was too late.</p>

<p>On the 30th January, 1884, the Cape Government,
in a minute signed by John X. Merriman,
recommended the annexation to the British Empire
of the whole of Great Namaqualand and Damaraland
from the Orange River to the Portuguese
border, the interests of the Cape Colony being
chiefly in the arming of natives by gun-running
through the port at Angra Pequena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Official and private notifications were sent to the
British Foreign Offices of the intention of Germany
to take over the suzerainty of South West Africa
in defiance of Great Britain's claims; but our Government,
fondly embracing the idea that Germany
had no intention of acquiring the territory but was
only solicitous for legal protection of private property,
still declined to act until the Cape Government
expressed their readiness to accept the
responsibility and cost.</p>

<p>On the 24th April, 1884, the day which has
recently been described in German publications as
"the Birthday of the German Colonial Empire,"
Bismarck telegraphed to the German Consul at
Cape Town as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to statements of Mr Luderitz,
Colonial authorities doubt as to his acquisitions
north of Orange River being entitled to German
protection. You will declare officially that he and
his establishments are under protection of the
Empire."</p></blockquote>

<p>This meant the annexation to Germany of the
whole territory; but communications continued
between the Home and the Cape Colonial Governments.</p>

<p>In the Reichstag on the 23rd June, 1884, Bismarck
showed his hand for the first time; and on
the point of infringement of Great Britain's "legitimate
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
rights," stated that no such infringement
could be pleaded inasmuch as in English official
documents the Orange River had repeatedly been
declared to be the north-western border of the Cape
Colony.</p>

<p>Bismarck further announced that it was the
intention of the Government to afford the Empire's
protection to any "settlements" similar to that of
Luderitz which might be established by Germans.
He added in his address to the Reichstag that
"if the question were asked what means the
Empire had to afford effective protection to German
enterprises in distant parts, the first consideration
would be the influence of the Empire and the wish
and interests of other Powers to remain in friendly
relations with it."</p>

<p>There was nothing left but for our Government
to bow at the triumph of superior diplomacy, and
the position was accepted with a good grace&mdash;Lord
Granville declaring that in view of the definitions
which had been publicly given by the British
Government of the limits of Cape Colony, the claim
of the German Government could not be contested,
and that the British Government was therefore
prepared to recognise the rights of the Germans.</p>

<p>There were some very violent expressions of
opinion on the part of Britishers who had vested
interests in this, the first of Germany's Colonies,
for there were many private rights concerned, and
it was decided that an Anglo-German Commission
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
should be appointed to inquire into and settle all
conflicting claims; but it is not of record that,
excepting in regard to the islands, the decisions
of the Commission were in favour of the British
traders who had for many years been established
along the coast of South West Africa.</p>

<p>The result of Luderitz's enterprise, supported
by Prussian diplomacy, was, therefore, that the
German flag waved over the whole extent of South
West Africa from the Orange River to the border
of Portuguese Angola, and Angra Pequena assumed
the responsibility of the name "Luderitzbucht."</p>

<p>In the meantime Herr Luderitz had established
his trading stations at St Lucia Bay on the coast
of Zululand, and proceeded to repeat the stratagem
he had followed in Angra Pequena by founding
trade stations at points inland while he opened
negotiations with Dinizulu.</p>

<p>The annexation of South West Africa had,
however, caused the British Government to throw
off some of their lethargy, and a British warship
was dispatched to St Lucia Bay, over which, by
virtue of a treaty made with the Zulu King Panda
some forty years previously, the British flag was
hoisted on the 18th December, 1884.</p>

<p>Danger of the Cape being cut off from the
north was, however, still extant in Bechuanaland,
where the Boers had annexed the territories known
as Stellaland, Goshen, and Rooigrond; but this
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
was eventually saved to Great Britain by vigorous
individual action on the part of Cecil Rhodes, who
had himself appointed a Commissioner to visit
Bechuanaland, where he strenuously opposed the
claims of the Transvaal Republic.</p>

<p>These claims were, however, only withdrawn in
the following year after an expedition under Sir
Charles Warren had proceeded to the disputed areas
and persuaded the Boers that Great Britain was this
time in real and eager earnest.</p>

<p>Bechuanaland became a British "Protectorate,"
and the well-laid scheme for a German transcontinental
Empire was frustrated.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the territory brought under
German sway in South West Africa were defined
by what is known as the Caprivi Treaty of the
1st July, 1890, between Germany and Great Britain,
and by an agreement between Germany and Portugal.
Under the terms of the latter the northern
boundary of German South West Africa, between
that Colony and Portuguese Angola, was fixed at
the Cunene River; while under the Caprivi Treaty
the boundary between the Cape Colony and German
South West Africa was declared to be the Orange
River.</p>

<p>Great Britain retained Walfisch Bay, which
became a "district" of the Cape Colony and was
placed under the Colonial administration in 1884,
and also kept the territory round Lake 'Ngami in
northern Bechuanaland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The lake district was neglected, however, until
Cecil Rhodes, fearing the loss of more territory
unless it was beneficially occupied, sent, at his own
expense, an expedition of Boer trekkers to
settle on the land.</p>

<p>Article III of the Caprivi Treaty was an important
one, for thereunder it was provided that Germany
should "have free access from her Protectorate
(South West Africa) to the Zambezi River by a
strip which shall at no point be less than twenty
English miles in width."</p>

<p>The acquisition by Germany of South West
Africa was of great strategical importance, enabling
them to establish in time a system of communication
by wireless telegraphy which covered the
whole continent.</p>

<p>In Togoland on the west coast the most powerful
wireless apparatus in the world was installed, and
this was in touch both by wireless and cable with
Berlin.</p>

<p>The Togoland station was also in touch with the
wireless installation at Windhoek, the capital of
German South West Africa, and with Dar-es-Salaam,
the German port on the east coast opposite
Zanzibar.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is a matter for congratulation, but not on the
statesmanship displayed by British ministers, that
the fruit of the German essay at the establishment
of a "new Empire" in Southern Africa was no
more than the annexation of South West Africa, for
it is by no means unthinkable that there was a
possibility that in addition to the south-west the
Germans might have drawn a wide belt right across
the continent from west to east, taking in Bechuanaland,
the Transvaal, Tongaland, and that portion
of Zululand giving the Transvaal an outlet to the
east coast at St Lucia Bay.</p>

<p>The territory hitherto known as German South
West Africa covers an area of nearly 323,000 square
miles, and has a coastline of 930 miles from the
mouth of the Orange River, which separates it from
the Cape Colony in the south, to the mouth of the
Cunene River, which divides the territory from
Portuguese Angola in the north. The southern
boundary runs along the Orange River into the
interior for some 300 miles.</p>

<p>The German population is stated to be about
15,000, and the natives are estimated at 200,000;
but this latter is probably a high calculation, in
view of the number who have fled into Bechuanaland
and Cape Colony to escape from German
tyranny.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the German Government
after their annexation of Damaraland and Great
Namaqualand was to declare the claims of British
concessionaires invalid.</p>

<p>The "rights" of Herr Luderitz were taken over
by a chartered company, incorporated by the
Government, which set itself to investigate the
resources of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The islands off the coast remained British, and
there the huge deposits of guano have been worked
for years.</p>

<p>A form of military government was established,
who proceeded to impress the natives with the
might of Germany; but the Hereros who occupied
Damaraland never acknowledged even a German
suzerainty, and in 1904 a "rebellion" broke out.</p>

<p>Utterly unaccustomed as they were to warfare of
the description they were now called upon to undertake,
the Germans found great difficulty in dealing
with the "Hottentots," as the natives were termed;
and the German effort to destroy the whole tribe
involved the employment of 9,000 regular troops
and an expenditure of &pound; 20,000,000.</p>

<p>The Herero War was carried on for nearly three
years, and in 1907 was brought to an end by Major
Elliott of the Cape Police; for the principal Herero
chiefs crossed the borders of the Cape Colony,
where they were routed by Major Elliott's force
of police and their leaders captured. They were
detained for a time by the Cape Government, and
finally handed over to the German authorities, by
whom they were executed.</p>

<p>Major Elliott was thanked and duly decorated by
the Kaiser.</p>

<p>The Germans did not find tribes of natives on
whose industry they could batten, and the inhabitants
of Great Namaqualand and Damaraland were
really unpromising material for such a purpose, not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
being pure-bred distinctive tribes, but bastard races
with a strong admixture of half-castes.</p>

<p>For decades the territory had been the refuge of
criminals and cattle thieves, who had fled from the
Cape Colony, after raiding the Bechuana cattle
kraals.</p>

<p>A great deal of the coast and part of the southern
portion of the Colony is little else than an arid,
waterless waste; in fact the rainfall in parts has
been known to be half an inch in two years.</p>

<p>Even at Walfisch Bay there is no fresh water to
speak of, and for years water for all purposes was
brought up the coast by steamers. It is a condition
prevailing all along the coast, for even at Port
Nolloth in Lesser Namaqualand, south of the
Orange River, the inhabitants depend upon water
condensed by the sea fogs and dripped from the
roofs into tanks, which are by the way kept locked
to prevent theft of the precious liquid.</p>

<p>Powerful condensers have, however, for some
time been used at various points on the coast to
provide fresh water, and this is retailed at a high
price.</p>

<p>The Kalahari Desert stretches over the border of
the Cape Colony and into Bechuanaland, and contains
no surface water; although good results have
been obtained by drilling to comparatively shallow
depths, and the sandy soil proved highly productive
on irrigation.</p>

<p>The desert itself was occupied by nomad bushmen
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
armed with bows and arrows poisoned by
being laid in putrid human flesh, and who kept
secret the places where they obtained water. Many
of these are pools hidden beneath the earth's
surface and from which the water can only be
drawn up through a narrow channel by suction
through a bamboo reed.</p>

<p>A good substitute for water is found in the wild
melons which grow in patches in the driest parts
of the Kalahari, and on these police patrols in
Bechuanaland have often to rely for water for themselves
and animals.</p>

<p>The arid zone is limited, however, and towards
the north-east the land gradually rises to an elevated
tableland, possessing a dry and one of the most
perfect climates in the world.</p>

<p>Approaching Angola again farther north the
country becomes almost tropical.</p>

<p>The majority of the veld is of the karoo type,
covered with the remarkable karoo bush on the
leafless twigs of which sheep thrive and fatten.
The salt bush, similar to that valued in Australia
for sheep, is found in abundance, but towards the
north and coming under the influence of a rainfall
the land, while there is no marked geological difference,
produces grass instead of the salt bush, and
there are belts of rich grass country as fine as any
to be found in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Damaraland is in reality one of the finest cattle
countries in Africa, while nearly the whole country
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
is suitable for sheep and goats. With energetic
development there is a big future for it as a producer
of hides, wool, and mohair.</p>

<p>Horses do well in many parts of South West
Africa; in fact in Namaqualand, along the Orange
River, a breed of hardy ponies exists in a
semi-wild state. In the drier parts camels are
extensively used both by British and German
patrols.</p>

<p>The most waterless area near the coast produces
a shrub known by the Boers as <i>melk bosch</i> (milk-bush),
which carries a plentiful supply of a milky
sap which has been manufactured into a fair
quality of rubber; but the difficulty of its collection
militates against the prospects of its development
into a prosperous industry.</p>

<p>The number of head of cattle, the property of
the natives but transferred to the Germans by
conquest, was, in 1913, estimated at 240,000,
wool-bearing sheep 660,000, and other sheep,
including Persians, at over 500,000. There were
approximately the same number of goats, 20,000
horses, and 3000 ostriches.</p>

<p>In the northerly portion, suitable for agriculture,
this was carried on by natives; but their land was
confiscated by the Germans, and, as Dr B&ouml;nn stated
in a reading upon the Colony, "the framework
of society is European; very little land is in the
hands of natives."</p>

<p>The land was parcelled out into farms and allocated
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to companies and Boer settlers, the average
size of a farm being about 28,000 acres.</p>

<p>Ostriches are found in many parts in a wild state,
and a great number have been domesticated; but
the German traders preferred as a rule to rely for
their supply of feathers upon the plumes of wild
birds killed by the bushmen of the Kalahari.</p>

<p>Of other industries mention might be made of
the collection, besides guano, of penguin eggs and
seal skins on the islands off the coast, while a
few degrees north whalers, operating from Port
Alexander, last year accounted for some 3000
whales.</p>

<p>As at the Cape of Good Hope, the whales met
with are of the less valuable "hump-backed"
variety, but an occasional "right" or sperm whale
is captured.</p>

<p>Of ordinary trade there was practically none, as
the natives had little or nothing to give in exchange
for imported goods; and as for the Boer settler,
beyond a little coffee and sugar, he has learned
to rely only upon the resources of his farm for his
requirement. The natives' only asset of value to
the German, his labour, he was not disposed to
trade in.</p>

<p>Investigation has revealed the existence of mountains
of marble, varied in colour and of a quality
equal to Carara; while enormous deposits of
gypsum exist.</p>

<p>The whole country is highly mineralised. Silver
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
first attracted the attention of prospectors but has
never been found in payable quantities, although
large veins of galena have been traced.</p>

<p>The development of the mineral resources is
almost entirely British, and Johannesburg financiers
have opened up copper and gold mines.</p>

<p>Enormous deposits of haematite iron and asbestos
are known to exist, but so far have not been worked.</p>

<p>Copper, gold, silver, tin, and lead have been
worked profitably; but the principal mining industry
is diamond washing, and this is mainly in
Government hands.</p>

<p>No mine or pipe has been discovered, but the
diamonds are found in the loose sand on the foreshore
under conditions similar to those prevailing
at Diamantina in Brazil.</p>

<p>The diamonds are "dolleyed," and picked out
by natives under supervision; but there are a few
individual diggers upon whose net production the
Government levied a tax.</p>

<p>The output of diamonds in 1913 was valued at
&pound;3,000,000, the stones being disposed of under
State agency, who occupy the same relative position
to the industry as the De Beers Diamond
Buying Syndicate to the Kimberley mines.</p>

<p>Diamonds and their concomitants such as olivine,
rubies, garnets, etc., have also been discovered on
the islands, and in 1906 the discovery of a true pipe
was reported on Plum Pudding Island.</p>

<p>A syndicate was formed in England, and an
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
expedition, fitted out with great secrecy, was sent
out in the S.S. <i>Xema</i>; but on arriving at Plum
Pudding Island they not only discovered that a
tug, dispatched by a Cape Town firm, had visited
the island and claimed discoverers' rights, but that
by order of the Cape Government no landing was
permitted for fear of disturbing the sea-birds, on
whom the guano industry depended.</p>

<p>The capital of South West Africa was established
at Windhoek, 235 miles inland, and here a large
five-tower wireless station was built, which could
under the most favourable conditions communicate
direct with Berlin, but was otherwise in touch via
Togoland.</p>

<p>Windhoek is connected by a railway line with
the coast at Swakopmund at the mouth of the
Swakop River close to Walfisch Bay, and 1318
miles of railways have been built.</p>

<p>The Administration has laid down a network of
roads and telephones, which presents a contrast to
some of our Colonies where the means of communication
are extremely difficult, but points at the
same time to expensive administration.</p>

<p>Signposts are placed everywhere in the country,
indicating the direction of water or villages.</p>

<p>While Luderitzbucht is a fine harbour, the lack
of fresh water made the Germans select Swakopmund
as the principal point on the coast, although
it possesses an open roadstead and a heavy
sandy bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>From Swakopmund the principal railway through
Windhoek links up with the line from Luderitzbucht
at Keetmanshoop, and the lines, as in other
German Colonies, strike significantly towards
British borders.</p>

<p>The Caprivi strip, running into northern
Rhodesia, and presented to Germany under the
agreement of 1890&mdash;which the newspaper <i>South
Africa</i> termed "a most iniquitous one"&mdash;was of
great importance to Germany's aspirations in the
interior, inasmuch as Germany aimed at the construction
of a German line over German territory
to connect with the Rhodesian Trans-African line
near the Zambezi. The strip indeed abuts for
about 100 miles on the Zambezi.</p>

<p>No effort has been made to develop it, and under
a heavy penalty no one was allowed to enter the
strip.</p>

<p>A line such as that under contemplation by the
Germans is, however, now in course of construction
from Lobito Bay (Benguella) in Portuguese
territory.</p>

<p>The only real settlers in South West Africa are
Boers who trekked from the Transvaal and Cape
Colony. It has been said that where you find Boers
you may be sure to find the pick of the farming
land, and the Boer farms are widely scattered over
Damaraland.</p>

<p>The German system, however, was not likely to
appeal to such spirits of independence as the Boers,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
especially when the Germans meted out to those
Boers whom they employed as transport-riders
during the Herero campaign, the same treatment
as to the natives, and in some cases had Boers
tied up to wagon wheels and flogged for minor
offences.</p>

<p>Taken in all, the Colony is one the development
of which has been carried on on strategical rather
than commercial lines; but it is a territory of vast
possibilities as a pastoral land, and as there is at
present all over the world a shortage of meat, likely
to intensify, the holder of a vast extent of country
suitable for raising cattle possesses a most valuable
asset.</p>

<p>There cannot be the least doubt that in common
with the rest of Germany, South West Africa had
for some time been preparing for the anticipated
inevitable war with Great Britain, and a much
larger number of German troops were held in the
Colony than any fear of a possible native disturbance
warranted.</p>

<p>The German forces were estimated at no less
than 15,000, with at least 30 batteries of guns.</p>

<p>A plan had, as events have subsequently revealed,
been laid for the invasion of the South
African Union, which was to be overrun with the
assistance of the Boers&mdash;on whose co-operation the
Germans were fatuous enough to imagine they
could count.</p>

<p>Holding their own Colonies by terrorism, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
held an utterly false conception of the relation of
our Colonies to the mother country.</p>

<p>The Germans in South West Africa, at the outbreak
of the war, had succeeded in bribing and
corrupting an ex-Boer General, Maritz, and issued
a circular to the Boer farmers on the border, calling
upon them "to free themselves from English
dominion so long and unwillingly borne," and to
exchange the British "yoke" for the German
shackles. They forgot that the weight of the
"yoke" was never felt.</p>

<p>On the declaration of war, a section of the Boers
preached neutrality on the part of the Union, but
the Boer leaders themselves denounced this doctrine
as craven and pitiful.</p>

<p>While "a systematic German propaganda deliberately
attempted to poison the integrity of a
section of the people," to quote Mr John X. Merriman,
the Germans found in the Union Premier,
General Louis Botha, that, to the German mind,
incomprehensible being, a man imbued with the
sense of the very highest integrity and honour, in
whose nature it was impossible to contemplate a
breach of faith or to regard a treaty bearing his
signature as a "scrap of paper."</p>

<p>The Germans found to their intense surprise
Briton and Boer united, while the Union was swept
by a wave of intense patriotism, revealed in the
promise and offer of loyal support to General Botha
by every section of the varied comities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>From natives, Cape "Boys," and Malays alike
came assurances of their intense loyalty, with offers
of help; while the native contributions in cattle
swelled the relief funds.</p>

<p>Prior to the knowledge of Maritz's defection,
General Botha had only mobilised a few thousand
men for defence purposes; but on his assurance that
the Union was able to undertake its own defence,
the Imperial Government was enabled to remove
the garrisons of regulars for service on the
continent.</p>

<p>This was possibly regarded by the Germans as
a ruse on General Botha's part to get rid of the
British garrisons; and a few days after when a state
of war existed between Great Britain and Germany,
the Germans on the Orange River assumed the
offensive.</p>

<p>At Nakob a garrison of five South African
Mounted Rifles was attacked by 250 Germans with
three maxims, but nevertheless gave a good account
of themselves.</p>

<p>The traitor Maritz held an important command
under the Union on the Orange River, and on
1st October, doubtless through his treachery, two
squadrons of the South African Mounted Rifles
and a section of the Transvaal Horse Artillery were
led into a trap at Sandfontein, where they were
attacked by 2000 Germans with ten guns&mdash;and
overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The place was a veritable death-trap, being one
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the waterholes surrounded by kopjes; and the
Germans adopted the method employed against
themselves by the Hereros, who waited until their
enemies had encamped at a waterhole and then
attacked from the kopjes.</p>

<p>On the 13th October Maritz threw off his mask
and broke into open rebellion. He was, however,
easily dealt with by his late comrades, and fled
across the border.</p>

<p>Operations in this theatre are of course extremely
difficult, owing to the lack of water and the impossibility
of moving large bodies of men across
waterless tracks in order to attack an enemy who
is ensconced about the only available source of
water.</p>

<p>The principal advance, therefore, against the
Germans in South West Africa was by way of
Luderitzbucht and Swakopmund.</p>

<p>The rebellion of Maritz was followed later by
the defection of two distinguished ex-Boer Generals:
Beyers in the Transvaal and de Wet in the Orange
Free State. But they seem to have been actuated
in prostituting their otherwise unsullied careers by
jealousy and petty spite against General Botha
personally, and not animated by any anxiety to
come under German dominion&mdash;though de Wet's
principal grievance against the British Government
appeared to be that an English magistrate
had fined him five shillings for assaulting a native,
and that instead of admonishing the native the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
magistrate had "looked at him as if he wanted to
kiss him."</p>

<p>Upon the outbreak of ex-Generals de Wet
and Beyers, supported by the rag-tag and bobtail
of the more ignorant Boers, General Botha ordered
a further mobilisation in the Union, and decided
to take the field in person, being the first Premier
of a British dominion to do so at the head of his
own troops.</p>

<p>He immediately proceeded against Beyers, and
the latter was defeated and fled, subsequently meeting
his death by drowning in the Vaal River.</p>

<p>General Botha then turned his attention to de
Wet, who with a partially armed force had commenced
blowing up railway lines and destroying
bridges, and after a prolonged chase de Wet was
captured and the pitiful rebellion ended.</p>

<p>The Union troops, under the command of
Colonel Beves, arrived off Luderitzbucht on 19th
September, and were landed by tugs without
opposition.</p>

<p>A party of the South African Railway Engineers
took charge of the electric power station, telephone
and condensing plant. The town was searched for
arms, and a large quantity unearthed; but there
was not the slightest injury to any person or
property.</p>

<p>A special party was landed under a flag of truce
to demand the surrender of the town; and having
returned with the principal German officials as
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
hostages, the official entry was made by Colonel
Beves, and the Union Jack was hoisted over the
town hall.</p>

<p>The Germans had retired to the capital at Windhoek,
where they were said to have three years'
provisions and stores, and had removed from
Luderitzbucht all railway rolling stock, but had
damaged no property.</p>

<p>Colonel Beves issued a proclamation formally
annexing the town, and providing for the security
of life and property.</p>

<p>Prisoners of war and non-combatants were sent
off to Cape Town. The latter included a number
of Cape "Boys" who had been paid their wages
in German <i>goodfors</i>; and these expressed their
delight at the British occupation. The <i>goodfors</i>
were cashed by Cape Town merchants for the
"Boys," and were passed on in payment of
amounts claimed from them by German subjects.</p>

<p>The occupation was conducted in the most orderly
manner, and the late German residents of Luderitzbucht
were loud in their expressions of appreciation
of the consideration with which they were
treated.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Caprivi strip was entered by a force of
police from Rhodesia, and within a few days
Schuckmannsburg, near the Zambezi River, surrendered
to them&mdash;and so a very unsightly
intrusion into Rhodesian territory was wiped off
the map.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">EAST AFRICA</span></h2>


<p>In the early days of modern African history, when
Portugal was at her zenith and her richly laden
galleons were plying between the Cape of Good
Hope, Goa, and Calicut, practically the whole of
the trade of the east coast of Africa north of the
Zambezi River was in the hands of Arab-descended
"Sultans" and Portugal&mdash;who had extensive
"settlements" along the coast.</p>

<p>A trade with India, which in the past has been
the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of more strife and bitterness than
any subject&mdash;excepting religious intolerance, for
which nations have contended&mdash;had been established
for centuries, and the glamour of the East
pervaded the whole atmosphere of social and commercial
relations.</p>

<p>When the European nations started competing
for supremacy in the east coast trade, which had
always been a valuable one, the Arabs made the
Island of Zanzibar the centre of their activities.</p>

<p>The island was only chosen as the headquarters
of the supreme Sultan of the east coast and his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
palace built there at a comparatively late date, when
the Powers had already begun to bring under their
direct administration lands to whose native rulers
they had hitherto only extended a "protection,"
a benefit which had not been sought with any
spontaneity.</p>

<p>The selection of Zanzibar as the Sultan's headquarters
was due to the fact that it afforded a much-needed
secure place of retreat; but a trade between
Zanzibar, India, and the African mainland was
built up that rivalled that of the British East India
Company.</p>

<p>The trading expeditions of the Arabs, moreover,
took the form of devastating raids, and their territory
on the coast was but precariously held.</p>

<p>The importance of Zanzibar grew apace, and
more and more of the adjoining coast, sixteen miles
distant, came under the sway of the Sultans, whose
caravans pushed farther and farther into the
interior, returning laden with ivory and accompanied
by gangs of slaves, for which Zanzibar
became the market of the world.</p>

<p>The slave trade indeed assumed enormous proportions,
was almost entirely in Arab hands, and
although an international movement for the suppression
of the iniquitous traffic had been on foot
from the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
British Government alone took active measures in
East Africa to apply their humanitarian principles
of freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>With the wane of Portugal's power the influence
of Great Britain in Zanzibar and its dependencies,
the chief centres of which were the Island and Bay
of Pemba and Witu, grew and intensified until
Great Britain became, as was meet on account of
her possession of India, supreme in the Zanzibari
regions&mdash;a British Consul at Zanzibar being
appointed as early as 1841.</p>

<p>Up to 1884, although there had been no definite
annexation of territory, British influence was
extending in every direction, as British explorers
ventured farther and farther into the interior&mdash;adventurous
spirits stirred by the reports of the
Arabs of the great lakes existing in what was then
unknown Africa.</p>

<p>Central Africa remained a no-man's-land, inhabited
only by aborigines, and under no control
whatsoever excepting that exercised by the Arab
leaders of marauding and slave-trading expeditions,
whose principal commercial object was ivory&mdash;white
and black.</p>

<p>To mention but a few names, Burton, Speke,
Grant, Baker, all added to the world's knowledge
of the Dark Continent, and mapped out the region
about Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria and Albert
Nyanza; Burton, indeed, penetrated far enough
west to plant a British flag upon the majestic
mountains of the Kamerun, above the Gulf of
Guinea.</p>

<p>Their wanderings were inspired by the spirit of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
adventure innate in the British, and undertaken
with no sordid motive; while the results of their
labours became the property of the civilised
world.</p>

<p>In the course of their explorations the wanderers
unfolded the mystery of the source of the Nile in
Lake Victoria Nyanza, which had been the subject
of conjecture for centuries.</p>

<p>Of explorers other than British, was the German
Van der Decken, who had extensively explored the
interior round about Kilima 'Njaro, and who had
undoubtedly before him the attractive idea of a new
German Empire, embracing a large portion of
Central Africa; and who urged upon his countrymen
the desirability of acquiring part, if not the
whole of what was practically no-man's-land, from
the east coast opposite the Island of Zanzibar to
the mouth of the Congo in the west.</p>

<p>H. M. Stanley had explored Uganda, his report
on which caused that country to become infested
with missionaries whose subsequent squabbles
about forms and dogmas gave rise to more serious
disturbances amongst the Mazai and Waganda
than the slave trade.</p>

<p>Stanley had also crossed the continent, and in
the employ of Leopold, King of the Belgians,
made that far-seeing monarch's private venture
an enormously successful enterprise&mdash;embracing a
huge area, taking in from the western shore of
Lake Tanganyika (which it covered) the whole
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
country across the continent to the mouth of the
Congo.</p>

<p>The Congo Free State was born of King Leopold's
venture, and remained his private concern
until his death, when by his will he bequeathed the
territory, over 800,000 square miles in extent,
to Belgium.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned that the Belgian Congo
shut off along Lake Tanganyika British Central
Africa (Nyasaland) from British East Africa
(Uganda).</p>

<p>A Frenchman, M. Labaudy, in 1904 endeavoured
to emulate King Leopold, and proclaimed himself
Emperor of the Sahara; but his resources not being
quite in proportion to his ambitions, the Sahara
was not brought under his august rule.</p>

<p>While stamping out the slave trade, Great
Britain was, in 1884, bringing under her sway the
tribes on the east coast; and this was being accomplished
without much difficulty, accompanied, as
her dealings with natives were, by justice, which
more than any virtue appeals to the native mind.</p>

<p>From the north Great Britain had advanced
along the Nile, and to all intents and purposes
taken under protection the Nile country up to Lake
Albert Nyanza.</p>

<p>Round about Kilima 'Njaro Mr (now Sir) H. H.
Johnston had obtained concessions of territory;
but the necessity of actually and formally annexing
was not apparent to the Government, who
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
preferred to rely upon a process of gradual
absorption.</p>

<p>As early as 1874 German traders were establishing
themselves in Zanzibar and the territories of
the Sultan on the mainland, and "making a bid
for a fair share of the trade"; while Germany,
which had really only existed since 1871, made
the affairs of the Sultan of Zanzibar her business,
"because of Germany's interest in suppressing
slavery," which, however, the Germans did not
hesitate to practise extensively themselves as soon
as they had territorially established themselves.</p>

<p>There was never a more disinterested act than the
freedom of these human machines on the part of
Great Britain; for while she was insisting upon the
release of thousands and thousands of slaves, to
whose "masters" she paid large sums as compensation,
many industries in her Colonies were
not only hampered but closed down altogether on
account of the impossibility of procuring the native
labour necessary for their continuance.</p>

<p>The idea of Colonies forming a new German
Empire in Africa, which obsessed the minds of a
few individuals and later on appealed to the cupidity
of the German merchants, could not obtain the
all-powerful Bismarck's support until their proved
value as commercial propositions should justify him
in extending to them the Imperial protection. At
the opportune moment, however, he struck and
struck hard with his weapons of blood and iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Unending warnings were conveyed to our
Government as to the result of inaction in proclaiming
sovereignty over their "spheres of influence"
on the east coast, and in 1880 Sir Bartle Frere made
strong representations to the Government as to
Germany's growing influence; but the Government
remained incredulous of German designs.</p>

<p>The events of 1884, however, proved prognostications
to be correct, and the "scramble for
Africa" entailed a division of the territories of the
Zanzibari Sultan.</p>

<p>While Herr Luderitz was busy establishing trade
stations at Angra Pequena and St Lucia Bay, and
pushing inland to girdle Africa with a German belt,
other and less open methods were employed on the
east coast.</p>

<p>Dr Carl Peters was President of the new-formed
German Colonisation Society which was at the back
of the initiatory steps for acquiring oversea territory;
and he, with two friends, set out for Zanzibar
as a base of operations, being justifiably doubtful
of Luderitz's success in operating from St Lucia
Bay.</p>

<p>All Dr Peters's proceedings were enveloped in
great secrecy.</p>

<p>In workmen's garb the three made their way
across France and travelled as steerage passengers
to Zanzibar, and thence, towards the end of 1884,
proceeded up country and obtained, under the pretext
of "autograph collecting," the signatures of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Arab and native chiefs to treaties, with which they
hurried back to Berlin early in 1885 and founded
a company to exploit their "concessions"&mdash;the
company being known as the German East Africa
Society.</p>

<p>The territories covered by these concessions had,
through the British Consul, been offered by the
Sultan of Zanzibar to Great Britain, who, however,
declined to assume the protection until a real
necessity arose.</p>

<p>The necessity had now arisen, but Peters and his
friends were guarded by treaties bearing the signatures
of natives potentates, which according to
the ethics of German <i>kultur</i> were worthy of respect.</p>

<p>In 1885 the Sultan of Zanzibar was acquainted by
the British Consul of the annexation by Germany
of a large portion of his territory on the mainland
which had been proclaimed by Bismarck, and
instead of supporting the Sultan in his righteous
protest our statesmen, having been forestalled,
determined to give Germany all assistance to
establish herself as a neighbour; and the British
Representative received instructions "to co-operate
immediately with the German Consul-General in
forwarding German interests."</p>

<p>Lord Granville, however, reproached Bismarck
with not disclosing his real designs, which must
have caused that statesman many a sleepless
night.</p>

<p>On his part Lord Granville went out of his way
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to inform Bismarck, in 1885, that British capitalists
intended to build a railway from the east coast (the
Nairobi Railway) to the Nile lakes, and that "the
project would only receive the support of the
Brittanic Government if the latter were assured that
it would in no way interfere with German designs."
This to Bismarck might very easily have appeared
to be veiled sarcasm had he been dealing with a
man of his own kidney.</p>

<p>A demonstration of force on the part of Germany
was necessary to induce the Sultan of Zanzibar
to adopt the same humble attitude as the British
Government; and a formidable German squadron
appeared before the Sultan's palace on the 7th
August, 1885, and presented an ultimatum, on
which the Sultan bowed to the inevitable and
stoically watched himself depleted of his possessions
on the mainland, though he retained a considerable
portion of the coastline.</p>

<p>Zanzibar Island, indeed, itself fell under a
German form of suzerainty from this date until
1890, when Germany resigned all claims over the
island to Great Britain, in exchange for the cession
of Heligoland.</p>

<p>The slopes of Kilima 'Njaro were the scene of
the busiest activities of German agents prior to the
appointment of a Commission for the delimitation
of the respective British and German boundaries.</p>

<p>Although the concessions granted to Mr H. H.
Johnston in this desirable region were considerably
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
earlier than any German grants, our Government
agreed to allow all claims to remain in abeyance
pending the deliberations and decision of the joint
Boundary Commission.</p>

<p>Under the agreement come to by Great Britain
and Germany as the result of the report of the
Commission (1886), a strip of coastline 600 miles
in length was left to the Sultan of Zanzibar in
addition to his islands, while he gave up all claims
to Kilima 'Njaro.</p>

<p>Under the agreement practically the whole of the
magnificent Kilima 'Njaro region, with its fertile
slopes and foothills, was, through an uncalled-for
fit of generosity on the part of Great Britain, made
over to Germany&mdash;a concession which was made,
it was said, to humour a sentimental wish expressed
by the Kaiser to possess the highest mountain in
Africa.</p>

<p>The effect of this concession was, however, to
place severe restrictions upon the development of
British East Africa, and threatened to confine
British enterprise to exceedingly narrow limits.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Portugal could not look on with
equanimity at the partitioning out by Great Britain
and the upstart Power, Germany, of territory the
history of which was permeated by her traditions,
and protested against being excluded from the
deliberations of the Powers.</p>

<p>In view of the fact, however, that Portugal's
claims were based upon ancient rights held only by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
hazy recollection, and that she had never exercised
effective jurisdiction over the territory she claimed,
she was treated with scant consideration by Great
Britain, and no courtesy at all by Germany, who,
however, emphatically demonstrated the hopelessness
of the position by warning Portugal that any
action on her part displeasing to Germany might
result in the loss to her of any and all territory
she then held in Africa.</p>

<p>Portugal could but raise a loud lament and stamp
in impotent rage; but when, after the agreement of
1886, the Sultan of Zanzibar made coarse references
to the status of Portugal, the latter found her
limit of endurance, and developing a fit of naughty
petulance, proceeded to bombard for three days
several unprotected native villages on the Bay of
Tungi, on the main coastline belonging to the
Sultan, thereby by no means impressing the world
with an appreciation of Portugal's might.</p>

<p>The Germans after the agreement of 1886 proceeded
with energy and determination not only to
test the resources of their new "Colony," but to
extend their territorial sphere in every direction&mdash;a
proceeding which evoked a British protest and
necessitated a fresh delimitation of boundaries in
1890. This was effected by the Caprivi Treaty of
1st July, 1890, under which Germany received
ridiculously favourable consideration in every
demand.</p>

<p>In 1888 the whole of the remaining territory of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the Sultan of Zanzibar on the mainland was placed
under the administration of Germany by virtue of
a lease from the Sultan. The new area included
the magnificent harbour of Dar-es-Salaam, which
became the principal port on that portion of the
east coast.</p>

<p>Five days after taking possession of the newly
leased territory, the Germans managed to organise
an "insurrection" amongst the natives; and the
assistance of the Imperial (German) Government
was invoked by the German East Africa Society
to repress the "rebellion" which they had deliberately
incited.</p>

<p>Captain Hermann von Wissmann was at the
beginning of 1889 accordingly sent out with full
instructions to deal with the native revolt, and
having enlisted a thousand or more ex-British
<i>askaris</i> (native soldiers) and Zulus, he proceeded to
slay, burn, and destroy. A huge area was devastated
and the "rebellion" was quelled, while the
natives were thoroughly terrorised.</p>

<p>The principal sufferers, however, were British
Indians, owners of plantations and trading stations,
and these fled for protection to British territory or
crossed to Zanzibar.</p>

<p>The German East Africa Company was severely
censured in various quarters in connection with the
"insurrection," but pleaded that it was a movement
organised by the Arabs through jealousy at
the success of German trading stations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>This was credulously accepted by Great Britain,
who went to the length, when her co-operation was
sought by Germany in her need, of dispatching a
fleet which united with the German ships in establishing
a blockade all along the coast in Zanzibari
waters.</p>

<p>The Reichstag voted the sum of two million
marks "for the suppression of the slave trade and
the protection of German interests in East Africa,"
and this sum was used to meet the expenses of the
"campaign."</p>

<p>So far from expending millions of marks on the
cause of humanity, the Germans, on their own
admission, were largely employing slave labour on
their tobacco plantations.</p>

<p>The natives were not finally terrorised into submission
until late into the year 1890; and the
Germans, being firmly established, made their
position unquestionably secure by purchasing
from the Sultan, in the name of the German East
Africa Society, the whole of his territory on the
mainland for the sum of four million marks&mdash;only
a part of which was, however, ever paid.</p>

<p>The fact that the whole venture had passed into
the hands of the German Government was only
manifested by the fact that the Reichstag voted ten
and a half million marks partly for the purpose of
paying the Sultan of Zanzibar and partly for use
in the improvement and development of Germany's
new "Colony."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The territory under the sway of Germany on the
east coast of Africa was the largest of Germany's
Colonies, comprising an area double the size of
Germany itself, 387,000 square miles. On the
north the Colony is bounded by British East
Africa and on the south by the Portuguese Colony
of Mozambique.</p>

<p>Situated between the 2&deg; and 10&deg; S. the climate is
tropical, and in parts on the coast there are dense
mangrove swamps, with the usual luxuriant tropical
vegetation.</p>

<p>The country rises rapidly, however, towards
the interior where the Tanganyika plateau forms
a high and healthy tableland over 3,500 feet
high.</p>

<p>Range after range of mountains and foothills
divide the coast from the majestic peak of Kilima
'Njaro on the borders of British East Africa, and
whose slopes offer splendid conditions for European
settlement.</p>

<p>The white population numbers roughly 5,500,
mainly German officials, traders, soldiers, and
managers of plantations; for, as in the other German
Colonies, there are no settlers in the true sense,
although Professor B&ouml;nn has said that there are
"even some close settlements reproducing German
village life."</p>

<p>The civil population indeed is composed chiefly
of Britishers or Greeks, while there are, as elsewhere
along the coast, a great many Banyans or
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Indian traders, who are British subjects, nearly
every German being a soldier or an official.</p>

<p>The native population numbers 9,000,000&mdash;the
two principal tribes being the Urundi with 1,500,000
and the Ruandi with 2,000,000 respectively.</p>

<p>From the German point of view this was an
ideal "Colony," for there were abundant natural
resources and a dense native population whose industry
might assure prosperity for their German
masters.</p>

<p>In acquiring East Africa the Germans had made
a bid for the dominant interest in Central Africa
and had by no means lost hope of absorbing the
Congo Free State, which by international agreement
was open to Free Trade. They went so far
indeed as to offer to take the Congo Free State
under "protection" when the atrocities of the
Congo rubber-collecting trade were the subject of
European concern. The aim and end of such a
"protection" may easily be surmised.</p>

<p>Having settled down to the exploitation of
the territory Germany, with her trade methods,
began to oust the once all-dominant trade of
Zanzibar.</p>

<p>The latter depended on her trade with India and
the mainland, and the Germans instituted a direct
service of luxuriously appointed steamers to stop
goods from going to Zanzibar and being handled
twice. In the way German traders are able to cut
prices, it is probable that the saving of one
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
handling of the goods constituted the profit on
them.</p>

<p>A direct Indian service was also inaugurated
which further cut into Zanzibar trade; while a line
of steamers started to circumnavigate Africa, going
down the west coast to Cape Town and returning
up the east coast leisurely through the Suez Canal
back to Hamburg.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Germans had practically
the whole of the east coast trade in her
hands, and the German description of Dar-es-Salaam
as the metropolis of the whole of the East
African coast began to have some foundation in
fact.</p>

<p>After quelling the "insurrection" in 1889,
Major von Wissmann set the corps he had formed
to the building of Government offices and residences,
and the imposing edifices round about the
lagoon at Dar-es-Salaam are tribute to their skill.</p>

<p>A strong force of police was enrolled and consisted
of 260 Europeans and 2,750 men, who,
uniformed in khaki, were armed with the most
modern guns and rifles. They constituted a formidable
fighting force of sixteen companies, each
of which had several machine guns.</p>

<p>The natives are in the main mild-mannered; and
as long association with the Arabs made a condition
of slavery quite a natural existence, they
were readily terrorised, and the Germans found
ideal ground for cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Energetically the administration set to work to
open up the country by establishing centres of
trade; the country was intersected in every direction
by paths six feet wide for <i>machela</i><a id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> travelling, and
the natives were compelled to make these paths
free of charge and maintain them in good order.</p>

<p>The administration, German like, was all by rule
of thumb, and even the prices of food were everywhere
fixed by tariff. German home methods were
applied everywhere with a mixture, as in Zanzibar
itself, of a shoddy imitation of Indian life.</p>

<p>The Port of Dar-es-Salaam (the "Haven of
Peace") was made the capital, and from here the
principal railway runs into the interior.</p>

<p>From the coast the town is hardly visible, the
quiet lagoon on which it is built being so shut in
by bluffs; while the entrance is between coral reefs,
the passage through which is in some places not
much over fifty yards. The harbour is small but
is perfectly sheltered, and with its fringe of palms
makes a striking picture.</p>

<p>The town is laid out on luxurious lines with wide
well-paved streets, an extensive botanical garden,
electric light, and a powerful wireless installation.
The neighbouring native town is a striking contrast,
being squalid in the extreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The railway system extends for nearly 1,000
miles, and a line from Dar-es-Salaam to Lake
Tanganyika was being pushed on energetically.
The territory is eminently suited for the cultivation
of tropical agricultural products, and the export of
these amounts to roughly &pound;1,800,000 per annum&mdash;about
equally divided between European and
native.</p>

<p>The Germans have done no development themselves
for the production of raw material, but
the European plantations are huge farms in the
lower-lying country; and though on the slopes
of Kilima 'Njaro there are small holders, these
are in the main Englishmen, Greeks, or British
Indians.</p>

<p>The Germans did not grant a full title to land,
and intending planters had to buy their land from
natives and run the risk that their titles might not
be recognised, as the natives' claim to land had not
yet been adjudicated&mdash;which means, of course, that,
as elsewhere, the land had been "confiscated";
though it did not suit German policy immediately
to take it out of the hands of the natives.</p>

<p>The products grown on the European plantations
by what has passed from actual to semi-slave
labour, are principally coffee, rubber, cotton, and
sisal hemp. The European products were heavily
subsidised.</p>

<p>The natives contribute from the natural resources
of the country grain, medicinal herbs, copal, beeswax,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hides, wild coffee, wild rubber, palm-oil,
copra, and dairy products. They have been
encouraged in every way to increase their production
of raw materials by brutality and terrorism,
which almost depopulated the Ruanda country,
and by instruction in the methods of growing and
collecting.</p>

<p>A translation in the journal of the African Society
quotes Hans Zache in "Dressig jahre Deutsch-Ost-Africa"
(Thirty years of German East Africa):
"It is a falsely reasoned and falsely proved
humanitarianism which seeks to take no cognisance
of the education of the native <i>for manual work</i>.
Work is provided by the European planters so that
the Colony may benefit by increased production,
and not least also is it provided for the blessing of
the negro."</p>

<p>The blessing is not altogether so apparent to
the negro, regarded in conjunction with the fruit
of his labour&mdash;usually dishonourable stripes.</p>

<p>The European plantations are in the hands of
758 planters, and cover an area of about 250,000
acres&mdash;of which 80,000 were planted with rubber,
50,000 with sisal, and 35,000 with cotton; while
1,000,000 cocoa-nut trees were also put in.</p>

<p>Ivory, which for years was the chief article of
export, has given place to sisal; and in 1913 the
value of sisal hemp exported approached &pound;500,000,
rubber taking second place with &pound;325,000.</p>

<p>Sisal culture in East Africa is of recent origin,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and was started in German East Africa with a
few plants imported from Central America. The
cultivation is difficult and the treatment of the
leaves equally so, but millions of plants now exist
in both German and British East Africa. The
exportation of sisal plants was prohibited by the
German Government. While sisal takes about
seven years to mature in the West Indies, it takes
only three in East Africa.</p>

<p>In contrast to the tropical Colonies on the west
coast, the cotton-growing is chiefly in the hands
of the whites&mdash;not solely in the natives. In 1912
it formed the principal crop, with an output of
1,882 tons.</p>

<p>The "slump" in rubber proved a set-back in the
economic development of the Colony.</p>

<p>A report of the Consul at Dar-es-Salaam states
the number of rubber trees planted and ready for
tapping were 19,000,000.</p>

<p>The report proceeds: "Owing to the low prices,
all the plantations have limited the number of hands
employed, and two of the largest suspended tapping
entirely. The planters are heavily handicapped by
having to pay the costs of recruiting labour in the
interior and its transport down to the plantation.
The costs often amount to about &pound;2, 10s. per head
before work is begun, and the rate of wages is high&mdash;about
16s. 6d. per month for a Wanyamwezi
tapper. Owing to a slight rise in the price of
rubber, tapping has been resumed by some of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
planters, and there is a more hopeful feeling. The
small planter has probably a better chance than the
large company; his working expenses are less, he
can often obtain local labour cheaply or get time-expired
hands without paying recruiting fees; and,
in addition, he can keep his men under more personal
control.</p>

<p>"The outlook for the larger estates is far from
reassuring, and it is said that some of them have
already begun to cut down the rubber trees to make
room for other crops. The Colonial Economic
Committee is taking steps to introduce a standard
quality of East African rubber, the absence of which
is another difficulty which has hampered the
planters.</p>

<p>"There is only one large washing and curing
factory in the Colony, at Muhesa, though there are
several smaller ones in Usambara. Most of the
planters wash the rubber themselves, with the result
that it has often to be done again in Europe."</p>

<p>The natives collect rubber from the wild forest
vines, but rubber balls sent in by Europeans and
natives alike are cut through the middle to detect
the presence of a core of leaves or other foreign
substance.</p>

<p>Cotton and coffee are articles also jointly produced
by planters and natives.</p>

<p>As elsewhere in tropical Africa, cotton grew wild
and is now extensively cultivated&mdash;the value exported
in 1912 being &pound;105,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The coffee produced by the natives is either
collected from the trees which grow wild or by cultivating
the indigenous plants. The wild coffee has
a small misshapen bean, but is excellently flavoured,
the quality of the bean improving with each year
of keeping. The value of coffee exported amounts
to about &pound;100,000 per annum.</p>

<p>On the highlands oats, barley, and wheat are
grown successfully; and other articles of export are
hides and skins, coming chiefly from the district
round Lake Victoria and from the provinces of
Ruanda and Urundi, which abound with millions
of head of cattle and other live stock.</p>

<p>The slopes of the highlands are covered with
short sweet grass, and are well watered with perennial
streams, which might easily be diverted into
channels to irrigate the land below.</p>

<p>Though sheep do well in parts, the grass in the
main grows too coarse for any small stock, and
requires feeding down.</p>

<p>The cattle are still nearly all in the hands of the
natives, but the Germans turned the hides to profit,
&pound;200,000 worth having been exported in 1912.</p>

<p>The exportation of cattle is prohibited, but traders
from Rhodesia have made their way up into German
East Africa, where they traded cattle from
the natives at prices averaging about 40s., and
managed to return with large herds of the quaint
"hump-backed" beasts, known as "Madagascar
cattle," to southern Rhodesia, where they found
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
a ready market at an average price of about
&pound;7, 10s.</p>

<p>Horses do fairly well in parts of the country only,
but a small variety of extremely hardy and strong
donkey is plentiful; and these are most useful for
transport work, being able it seems to live on the
memory of a pannikin of maize, and capable of
being packed with any weight.</p>

<p>The cultivation of chillies and pea-nuts is exclusively
a native industry, and the export of pea-nuts
in 1912 amounted to &pound;62,500.</p>

<p>The collection of palm-oil and copra, too, is in
native hands, the nuts being collected from the
wild palms which grow in their thousands on the
coast belts.</p>

<p>The European planters in recent years commenced
cocoa-nut palm cultivation, but the million
trees planted have not yet come to maturity.</p>

<p>Gum-copal, the resin of an indigenous tree, used
for varnishing, and the wax of wild bees is also
collected by the natives in the forests, and the
export of beeswax in recent years has averaged
about &pound;50,000.</p>

<p>This system of collection by natives means the
reduction of economic resources, as in collecting
wild rubber the vines are destroyed and so are the
swarms of bees in the search for wax.</p>

<p>There are other trees capable of commercial
exploitation, such as the baobab (cream of tartar
tree), cazou, the nuts of which are largely exported
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
from Jamaica, and wattle, the bark of which
produces tannin.</p>

<p>The timber possibilities are great, as large forests
of cedar exist and a certain amount has been
exported.</p>

<p>The geological formation is similar to British
East Africa; and although prospecting for minerals
is not encouraged, gold in payable quantities has
been discovered and worked, and gold to the value
of about &pound;30,000 has been exported annually for
some years.</p>

<p>Mica of good quality is found in the Uluguru
Mountains on the Tanganyika railway about 124
miles from Dar-es-Salaam, and about 100 tons are
exported annually.</p>

<p>A promising proposition exists at Magadi in a
large lake of carbonate of soda, which a British
company has endeavoured to secure. In time this
should prove one of the principal industries, as the
deposit appears to be unlimited. The inter-native
trade does not amount to much, as in this direction
the Indian can compete with and outreach even
the German.</p>

<p>As a "commercial" Colony for the production
of raw materials, the Germans looked upon their
East African territory as the jewel of their
possessions.</p>

<p>It was intended to give in August, 1914, a demonstration
of the economic life of the Colony, and to
hold at Dar-es-Salaam an exhibition for the whole
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
country, to be connected with the opening of the
working of the whole length of the Tanganyika
railway.</p>

<p>The exhibition was to have been held under the
patronage and graced by the presence of the German
Crown Prince, and festivities extending over
a fortnight were arranged for. German firms were
to have sent a large number of exhibits, and
numbers of visitors from Europe were expected.
Visitors have certainly since arrived, but not in the
guise it was anticipated.</p>

<p>On 8th August, 1914, H.M.S. <i>Pegasus</i> and
<i>Astraea</i> appeared before Dar-es-Salaam and proceeded
to destroy the powerful wireless station, and
in a few hours the town and several liners in
the harbour surrendered.</p>

<p>The <i>Pegasus</i> was subsequently attacked by the
<i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i> while the former was at anchor, and
being outranged was destroyed.</p>

<p>The <i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i> did not, however, have a long
spell of liberty, for she was shortly afterwards discovered
by H.M.S. <i>Chatham</i> hiding in shoal water,
sheltered from view by dense palms, about six miles
up the Rufigi River Opposite Mafia Island, and put
out of action.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Meanwhile British forces composed of Sikhs,
other Indian troops, and King's African Rifles,
whose headquarters are Zanzibar, proceeded from
British Central and British East Africa to occupy
the German territory.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">TOGOLAND AND KAMERUN</span></h2>


<p>When the Germans entered the field of Colonial
enterprise in 1884, the European Powers chiefly
concerned in Africa were Great Britain, France,
and Portugal&mdash;the latter's connection with the
Dark Continent, indeed, dating from the earliest
days of its modern history.</p>

<p>Portuguese power had, however, been for some
time in process of decay, and her influence was on
the wane.</p>

<p>The interests of France were centred in the north
and north-west of the continent, while Great Britain
was supreme in the south.</p>

<p>The adventure of Leopold, King of the Belgians,
on the Congo was still a private venture in the
hands of H. M. Stanley, and had not yet borne
fruit in the shape of the Congo Free State.</p>

<p>British and French had been actively engaged
in operations for the suppression of the slave trade,
but the energies of the two countries were at this
time being devoted rather to the development of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
trading stations established on the Gold and Slave
Coasts on the Gulf of Guinea.</p>

<p>"Spheres of influence" were being leisurely
demarcated by France and Great Britain&mdash;the latter
feeling so secure in her position that she hardly
treated seriously, in fact scouted, the notion of being
rivalled in her supremacy.</p>

<p>For some considerable time Germany had been
making an effort to secure a portion of the trade of
the west coast, overcoming the difficulty of introducing
her cheap and inferior goods by giving
them English and French trademarks, quite in
keeping with the best principles of German trade.</p>

<p>Trading stations on the Gulf of Guinea were
established by Germans, who immediately, employing
the obsequiousness which has enabled the
German to tread many an unaccustomed path,
began to approach native chiefs for concessions.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole territory, known respectively
as the Grain Coast, Gold Coast, Ivory Coast, and
Slave Coast, was beneficially occupied by the
French and British; but parts had not been formally
annexed between the British Colony of the
Gold Coast and French Dahomey. The French
really had a prior claim, but the natives were continually
petitioning the British Government to take
them under their protection.</p>

<p>In French Dahomey itself Germans had established
many trading stations, and began to pay
particular attention to a strip of the Slave Coast
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
between Lome Bay and Popo, including Porto
Seguro.</p>

<p>Great Britain had not yet awakened to Germany's
real intentions, and all her policy was accompanied
by procrastination and dilatoriness. The repeated
petitions of the natives for British protection were
ignored or put aside "for inquiry and consideration,"
pending which the natives received no reply
to their applications.</p>

<p>The lesson taught at Angra Pequena, where the
whole of the south-west coast from the Orange
River to Portuguese Angola was lost to Great
Britain in spite of the strenuous efforts of the
Colonial statesmen, was ignored; though it must
be conceded that there was an influential section in
England strongly opposed to further increasing
Great Britain's responsibilities oversea and thus
hampering the Colonial and Foreign Offices.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1884, an emissary of the
German Government, Dr Nachtigal, was dispatched
to the west coast of Africa, ostensibly as a
Trade Commissioner, to inquire into and report
upon the progress of German commerce.</p>

<p>Bismarck having decided on his policy of "Trade
Colonies" under Imperial protection, pursued it
vigorously and with his usual diplomacy.</p>

<p>He immediately acquainted the British Foreign
Office with the fact of the mission, but took the
opportunity of hoodwinking Lord Granville as to
its object&mdash;if he did not actually disclaim any intention
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of territorial acquisition. Dr Nachtigal proceeded
to the French settlements on the Ivory
Coast, and interviewed the German traders there
in preparation for his <i>coup</i>; thence he made for the
thirty-two mile strip south of Lome, now known as
Togoland, and on the 5th July the German flag was
hoisted and the territory declared annexed by
Germany.</p>

<p>The natives accepted the position quietly, having
been impressed with the greatness of Germany by
plentiful gifts of firearms and spirits.</p>

<p>While the coastline of Togoland is only 32 miles
in length, the area which the Germans claimed as
their "sphere of influence" widens to three or four
times that width in the interior.</p>

<p>In accordance with the amazing German native
policy, the next step to annexation was terrorism&mdash;the
mailed fist under the glove of peaceful trade,
and the natives were "taught a sharp lesson."</p>

<p>Germany's action in declaring a Protectorate
over Togoland met with protests from the British
and French Governments, and protracted negotiations
ensued and continued for some considerable
time; in fact it was not until 1897 that the boundary
line between Togoland and French Dahomey
was settled by a Franco-German agreement. The
western boundary was defined by the Anglo-German
agreements of 1890 and 1899.</p>

<p>On the south of the Gulf of Guinea, stretching
from Old Calabar to the French Congo, lies
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Kamerun (known also as the Cameroons) off which
is the Spanish Island of Fernando Po.</p>

<p>In 1842 the French occupied the Gaboon and
gradually brought under subjection the country
between the coast and the Congo; while a British
mission was established at Victoria in Kamerun
in 1858.</p>

<p>The country had for many years been explored
and opened up by British explorers and traders,
and the British flag had, in fact, been hoisted.
The territory had, however, never been formally
taken possession of, although the Dualla native
kings had for years petitioned the British Government
to be taken under their protection. At the
end of 1883 our Foreign Office decided to accede to
the natives' request, and to establish a Protectorate
over Kamerun.</p>

<p>Going about the business, however, in the usual
dilatory fashion, it was some six months before
instructions were issued to Mr Hewett, British
Consul, to proceed to Kamerun and declare the
territory annexed, subject to the willingness of the
Dualla kings to make concessions.</p>

<p>German traders had strongly established themselves
in the territory and had won over a considerable
number of the natives by the usual means of
bribery and unlimited gin.</p>

<p>Mr Hewett proceeded to Kamerun to find that
Dr Nachtigal had forestalled him.</p>

<p>Immediately after having hoisted the German flag
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
over Togoland, Dr Nachtigal at Kamerun commenced
negotiations with the Duallas; and when
the British Representative arrived the German flag
had been floating for several days over the mainland
opposite Fernando Po.</p>

<p>Germany's intentions were only now regarded
as serious in England, and by Mr Hewett, who
immediately left Kamerun and proceeded to make
treaties along the coast, thereby being instrumental
in securing the delta of the Niger, or that, too,
might have been lost to England.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The acquisition of Togoland and Kamerun by
Germany was looked on as a triumph of diplomacy
for Bismarck, who was reproached, it seems unreasonably
and peevishly, by Lord Granville for
not having disclosed the real object for which Dr
Nachtigal had been sent out. It is remarkable,
however, that in view of Germany's action in
South West Africa, which was even then the
subject of correspondence, the true purpose of the
mission was not divined.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Togoland</span></h3>

<p>Togoland enjoys the distinction of being the
smallest and at the same time the most prosperous
of the German Colonies. The Colony is 33,700
square miles in extent, with a coastline of only
thirty-two miles, reaching from Lome, on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
border of the British Colony of the Gold Coast, to
Grand Popo on the boundary of French Dahomey.</p>

<p>The French Colonies of Upper Senegal and
Niger are the northern boundary; while it is
bounded on the east by French Dahomey and by
the British Gold Coast on the west.</p>

<p>The climate is tropical, and like the rest of the
Guinea coast the coast-belt is hot, humid and
malaria-stricken, such as is generally met with in
low-lying forest country or on the coast at sea-level
anywhere in the Tropics.</p>

<p>Lying behind the coast-belt are stretches of
dense forest containing palms, rubber vines, and
considerable quantities of timber of good quality.
Arising farther inland are high and extensive
plateaux, many of the elevated parts being free
from malaria and capable of yielding quantities
of natural products. The richness of its natural
resources indeed made Togoland almost immediately
after annexation financially independent.</p>

<p>There is a German population in Togoland of
1,537, nearly all of whom are officials and soldiers;
and of the 131 so-called settlers, the majority are
plantation managers and overseers.</p>

<p>The native population amounts to 3,500,000,
and they are divided into numerous tribes, embracing
many degrees of <i>kultur</i> from raw cannibals
to comparatively civilised states.</p>

<p>The administration is in the hands of an
Imperial Governor, surrounded by a swarm of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
officials and a local council of unofficial members,
who are, as a rule, the representatives of merchant
houses.</p>

<p>Immediately on acquiring Togoland, the Germans
commenced sending trading expeditions
into the interior, and extending their "sphere of
influence" inland. A central trading station (Bismarcksburg)
was established, and a trade centre
was created for each tribe. Two hundred and
twenty miles of railway have been built in three
lines, all starting from Lome&mdash;one 80 miles in length
to Palime and another 120 miles to Atakpanie.</p>

<p>Lack of proper transport facilities has retarded
the development of the Colony, as owing to the
lack of transport animals nearly the whole of the
carrying of produce is done by natives.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the Colony is entirely due
to the exploitation of the natives; in fact the
economic life of the country depends upon the
natives' industry. Nearly the whole of the agriculture
is in the hands of natives, some of whom
have plantations of their own. Only 250,000
acres are in the hands of Europeans, and less
than a quarter of these are cultivated.</p>

<p>The hardships inflicted on the native, however,
are forgotten by the German trader in his excessive
eagerness to get as much as he can out of him;
and this has resulted in some rubber-collecting
districts in depopulation and a consequent falling
off in the production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal exports of Togoland are india-rubber,
palm-oil and kernels, cotton and cocoa.
Tobacco is also being tried with favourable
results.</p>

<p>Rubber forms nearly one-half of the total exports,
and is nearly all wild rubber collected by
natives from the forest vines&mdash;an expensive form
of production, as the vines are destroyed in the
process.</p>

<p>Palm-oil and palm kernels (largely used in the
manufacture of nut butter or margarine) forms
another important item. The nuts are collected
mainly from the palms originally introduced by
the Portuguese and now found in forests for many
miles from the coast.</p>

<p>In 1911 the export of palm kernels amounted to
13,000 tons, but fell to 7,000 tons in 1913 owing
to a scarcity of native labour.</p>

<p>The natives of Togoland are said to have cultivated
cotton in almost every part of the country
from time immemorial, and an average of about
500 tons is exported annually.</p>

<p>The Germans, realising the importance of this
article, did all they could to extend the cultivation
of cotton. The cultivation is entirely in the
hands of natives, but an agricultural school was
started for them by the Government to train them
in better methods of growing cotton, and they
were supplied with ploughs and other agricultural
implements as well as seed, free of cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain amount of cocoa is grown on native
plantations, 335 tons being shipped during 1913.
The natives have also taken kindly to a new crop
in the shape of maize, the export of which rose
from 103 tons in 1911 to 2,500 in 1913.</p>

<p>Although the conformation of the country is
very similar to British Nigeria and other parts
of the coasts where gold, tin, and other minerals
have been discovered and worked, the Germans
have not embarked upon the enterprise of having
the country prospected for minerals&mdash;a probable
cause being that prospecting entails expenditure
of money, and to the German this is the negative
purpose of a Trade Colony!</p>

<p>Besides being a source of wealth in trade,
Togoland was in reality of great strategical value,
being connected by cable with Germany and
with Dualla in the Kamerun; while Kamina was
connected by a powerful wireless installation with
Dar-es-Salaam in German East Africa and with
Windhoek, the capital of German South West
Africa.</p>

<p>On 26th August, 1914, Togoland was occupied
by the Gold Coast Regiment of the West African
Frontier Force, assisted by a French force from
Dahomey.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Germans destroyed the wireless station at
Kamina and asked for terms, but eventually
surrendered unconditionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kamerun</span></h3>

<p>Kamerun, on the Gulf of Guinea, south of
Togoland, and bounded on the north by British
Nigeria and on the south by the French Gaboon
(Rio Campo), comprises 291,000 square miles,
including 100,000 square miles ceded to Germany
out of French Equatorial Africa as the price of
the Moroccan Settlement, under the Franco-German
agreement of 1911.</p>

<p>The physical features are very similar to Togoland,
but much of the interior is mountainous&mdash;the
foothills and fertile slopes being covered with
dense vegetation.</p>

<p>There is the usual German population of
officials and merchants&mdash;1,871 in number; and a
native population of 2,500,000.</p>

<p>While not so prosperous as Togoland, Kamerun
has nevertheless been developed on the usual
German plan of officialism; but the natives have
not proved so tractable. It is possible that the
Dualla tribes still feel the disappointment at having
their petitions for protection by Great Britain
ignored; one German writer, indeed, speaks of the
Dualla natives as a hindrance to progress.</p>

<p>Kamerun was administered by an Imperial
Governor, a Chancellor and two secretaries, with
a local council of three merchants. Professor
B&ouml;nn pointed out that there are ample signs of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the growing strength of the administration, and
gives as an instance that there is a yearly increase
in the number of native criminals brought to
justice. The ever-increasing returns of the hut tax,
too, which in the Kamerun has nearly
doubled in the last four years, is pointed to as
proof of increased administrative efficiency.</p>

<p>Kamerun stretches into the interior to Lake
Tchad, in the direction of which a railway has
been built for 400 miles.</p>

<p>The trade of the Colony in 1912 amounted to
&pound;1,629,895 imports and &pound;1,102,803 exports, the
latter being the usual tropical products.</p>

<p>Cotton is known to have been grown and
cultivated round about Lake Tchad for centuries,
and agricultural experimental stations have been
established in the lake districts. As in Togoland,
the agriculture is all in native hands.</p>

<p>Kamerun has been held back by transport
difficulties which it was hoped to overcome by
building railways, and railway projects were
propagated energetically which it was hoped to
carry into effect shortly.</p>

<p>The usual means of transport, as in other parts
of the coast, is by native carrier; and the villages
are therefore grouped within a reasonable distance
of the main trade routes, paths which the chiefs
and people are responsible for keeping in order.</p>

<p>Palm-oil and copra are, as in the other West
African Colonies, the chief articles of export; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
palm kernels are daily coming more and more
into use in Europe as a substitute for butter,
and for the manufacture of cattle-food, etc. Two-thirds
of the copra exported from Kamerun,
amounting to &pound;300,000 worth in 1912, went to
Germany and one-third to England.</p>

<p>In the Colony itself five oil works have been
established, but owing to lack of transport it is
calculated that three-fourths of the yield of the
oil palm trees is left to rot on the ground
unused.</p>

<p>The forests of Kamerun hold an immense
quantity of trees bearing timber of excellent
quality, and this to the value of &pound;35,000 was
exported in 1912.</p>

<p>Round the Kamerun mountains exist large
tracts under cultivation of cocoa, of which 4,550
tons, valued at &pound;212,500, were exported in
1912.
The natives have been urged to extend this
industry, and travelling instructors were appointed
by the Government to train them in the best
methods of cultivation. More and more fresh as
well as dried bananas, too, have been exported
from Kamerun, and this trade offers a promising
field of enterprise.</p>

<p>Ten per cent of the exports of the Colony go to
England, while nearly 15 per cent of the imports
are of British origin.</p>

<p>The native policy is in the Kamerun worse, if
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
possible, than in Togoland, and the natives have
been systematically sweated. While the revenue
is principally obtained from customs dues and a
general <i>ad valorem</i> duty on imported goods (with
preference in favour of Germany of course), a poll
tax is levied upon natives, together with a toll
upon those using Government roads. There is
every reason to believe that the Dualla natives will
hail with delight deliverance from the German
yoke.</p>

<p>The British West African Frontier Force on
25th August, 1914, crossed the Anglo-German
frontier from Nigeria, and after considerable
opposition and suffering appreciable losses,
advanced on Dualla.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Cumberland</i> and <i>Dwarf</i> had, while
these events were taking place on land, reconnoitred
the mouth of the Kamerun River and the
approaches to Dualla, at the same time capturing
a number of German merchant liners.</p>

<p>On 24th September French troops from Libreville
attacked Ukoko in Corisco Bay, attended by
the French warship <i>Surprise</i>. The French and
British forces combined on 27th September in an
attack on the towns of Dualla and Bonaberi,
following upon a bombardment by the British
ships; and the towns surrendered unconditionally
to the allied force, after destroying the wireless
station.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Although some 1,500 prisoners were taken, a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
large portion of the garrisons, some 2,000 (whites)
in number, managed to escape to concentrate in
the interior. Of the prisoners 500 were handed
over to the French and the remainder, owing to
the difficulty of feeding them, sent to England.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">THE PACIFIC ISLANDS</span></h2>


<p>Of the islands in the southern seas where the
Indian and Pacific Oceans meet, and amongst
which Australia forms a fifth continent, some are
mere vaults in which repose the relics of ill-advised
and vainly attempted ventures, whilst others are
fruitful gardens wherein flourish the trees whose
sturdy growth testifies to the good seed from which
they sprang and the skill of the gardeners who
planted them.</p>

<p>The Archipelagos lying south of the China Seas
were first explored from the west by the Portuguese
and Dutch in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
but the steel glove upon which the mailed
fist seems afterwards to have been modelled failed
to retain a hold upon the territory which it
grasped.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Portuguese, indeed, abandoned their enterprises
in the southern seas in favour of developing
their trade between Goa and the east coast of Africa.
They excelled as navigators and explorers, but the
whole of their history shows that they have never
formed any conception of the principles of administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dutch concentrated on Java, Sumatra and
Borneo, and ever since have waged war with the
natives.</p>

<p>It seems strange that both these nations should
have decentralised Colonial interests away from
their home countries, in striking contrast to our
own country which has pursued a policy binding
her oversea dominions closer and closer to the
motherland&mdash;a policy which has eventuated in the
formation of a comity of nations firmly united by
the bonds of sentimental tradition and common
commercial interest.</p>

<p>The Portuguese made Goa the centre of their
East African and Eastern enterprises,<a id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and the
Dutch placed the Cape of Good Hope (while it was
in their possession) under the administration of
Batavia in the Island of Java.</p>

<p>The spice trade attracted adventurers of all the
pioneering nations. Spain made extensive voyages
of discovery and plunder in the South Seas, and
their galleons for many years provided the excitement
of the chase as well as profit in "double
pieces of eight" for British sea rovers; but the
Spanish acquired but a tentative hold upon territory,
and this was finally released by the Spanish-American
War of 1901.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The legacy of Spain to the South Seas was the
romantic occupation of searching for wrecks bearing
cargoes of doubloons and the abandoned booty
of pirates, which they seem to have collected for
the specific purpose of burying in brass-clamped
chests on uninhabited islands for the benefit of the
adventurous spirit who might in future years display
sufficient enterprise and determination to find
his way through the maze which surrounded the
prizes.</p>

<p>The latter part of the seventeenth century saw
one of the greatest periods of British activities in
venturing trade abroad, albeit it often-times took
the form of preying upon the rich cargoes collected
by the Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese marauders.
This, however, was then the most approved and
recognised form of commerce.</p>

<p>Direct trade in Borneo and Sumatra by the
British was commenced in about 1685, and
"factories" were established to develop the spice
trade which was then the richest of the East, a
cargo of pepper-corns being regarded as one of
the most valuable that could avoid a meddlesome
buccaneer and be safely brought to port.</p>

<p>The voyages of Captain Cook, whose name ranks
high amongst the pioneers of our Empire, and who
discovered and named many of the island groups
as well as the east coast of Australia, where he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
hoisted the British flag, really firmly established
British interests in the South Seas, after strenuous
struggles with the Dutch who regarded the area
as most particularly their "sphere of influence."</p>

<p>Through the last decades of the eighteenth
century British influence and prestige grew, and
the apathy of the statesmen at home was not
allowed by their sons on the spot to interfere with
energetic development and settlement which proceeded
apace.</p>

<p>Coming rather late in the day, France was,
through private British enterprise, forestalled in
her principal designs which were centred on New
Zealand, and her "protection" was only extended
to some small island groups such as New Caledonia,
lying between Australia and Fiji, and for which
she found use as penal establishments.</p>

<p>The big prizes of the Pacific&mdash;Australia, Tasmania,
and New Zealand&mdash;had fallen to the heritage
of Great Britain, and development rather
concentrated on these magnificent offshoots of
British oak.</p>

<p>There were other important groups of islands,
however, which, although locally regarded as
natural adjuncts of the Australian Settlements,
were not definitely taken possession of. The most
important of these were New Guinea and the
Samoan group.</p>

<p>New Guinea is divided from the Queensland
province of Australia by the shoal-dotted Torres
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Straits, about 90 miles wide; while the Samoan
Islands lie east of Fiji.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Magellan was the first discoverer
in the sixteenth century of New Guinea
(also known as Papua), while the new name
appears to have been given to the island by Ortiz
de Retez, who laid down certain points.</p>

<p>During the centuries succeeding, New Guinea
received frequent visitors representing European
nations, amongst them Captain Cook and Tasman,
whose name is perpetuated in Tasmania
though the island for many years bore the name
of his lieutenant, Van Diemen, and was known
as "Van Diemen's Land."</p>

<p>New Guinea was also frequently visited by
Chinese fishing junks in search of b&ecirc;che-de-mer,
or trepang.</p>

<p>The Dutch from their adjacent settlements in
Java and Borneo were supreme in the north of
New Guinea without exercising any effective
jurisdiction, and relied upon the difficult navigation
of New Guinea waters for a continuance of
their exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century they
(the Dutch) had practically a monopoly of the
spice trade, and were extremely jealous of any
other nations obtaining a footing in spice islands,
where their monopoly might be jeopardised.
They obstinately refused all access to New
Guinea; but the Dutch barrier was broken down
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
by emissaries of the British East India Company
in search of spice islands, and in 1793 New Guinea
was annexed by two commanders in the service
of the company, and the territory was thereafter
regarded as an adjunct of Queensland, although no
steps were taken for an administrative occupation.</p>

<p>In 1828 the Dutch erected a fortress to protect
the rights they claimed in New Guinea, but this
they abandoned in 1835.</p>

<p>While Samoa and numerous other groups of
islands were not incorporated in the dominions
of the countries whose explorers "discovered"
them, and their savage inhabitants were allowed
to continue their own administration, a brisk
British trade sprang up between Australasia and
the islanders.</p>

<p>The necessity for bringing either New Guinea
or the Samoan group under direct rule was not
an expediency that presented itself as an urgent
one to either the Imperial British or Australian
Governments as long as fair trading conditions
prevailed on harmonious lines and the lives and
private property of British traders were safeguarded,
until in about 1880 the tips of the tentacles
of the German octopus delicately spread out
to seek the spots whereon to plant the suckers of
trading stations, behind them the unlidded eyes
of Imperial Protection watching to gauge the
value of the prize and the parrot-beaked maw ready
to grasp for the satisfaction of Prussian greed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>A flourishing inter-coastal and island trade had
long been established by the United States of
America, but until 1898, when they annexed
Hawaii and occupied Samoa, the United States
adhered to their doctrine of not attempting territorial
acquisition outside their own continental
borders.</p>

<p>By 1883 the Germans had firmly established
themselves commercially, and their influence
began to be most markedly denoted in disaffection
amongst the natives and in inter-tribal wars&mdash;notably
in Samoa.</p>

<p>In this year the British New Guinea Colonising
Society proposed an expedition to Lord Carnarvon,
who was then Colonial Secretary, but the
minister declined to lend his support to an
enterprise which he considered entailed too much
risk.</p>

<p>The enterprise was imagined in collaboration
with supporters of Imperial extension in Australasia,
and, acting on their own initiative, the
Government of Queensland, with the approval of
the whole of Australia, annexed a portion of New
Guinea to her dominions; but this act was disavowed
by the British Government and declared
to be "null in point of law and not to be admitted
in point of policy."</p>

<p>Queensland most determinedly represented to
the Government of Australia and our Imperial
minister the danger to her commerce if New
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Guinea were to fall into the hands of a foreign
Power by annexation.</p>

<p>The prospect did not appear alarming to the
home statesmen, nor did further annexation of the
South Sea Islands enter into their scheme of
practical politics; and, therefore, when the proclamation
of a Protectorate over the whole of New
Guinea and the adjacent islands (including the
New Britain Archipelago, the Solomon, Caroline,
Palau, Marshall, and Ladrone Islands) under a
High Commissioner was determined on at a
conference held by the Australian Colonies at
Sydney in 1883 and recommended to the Imperial
Government, our Colonial Office met the proposal
with discouragement.</p>

<p>In November, 1884, however, the Home
Government was persuaded to proclaim in New
Guinea a Protectorate over the region lying
"between the 141st meridian eastward as far as
East Cape, with the adjacent islands as far as
Kosman Island."</p>

<p>This brought under the British flag the southern
portion of New Guinea, known as Papua, only;
but in other parts of the islands there were British
settlements originating in Australia which were
left under no effective jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In December, 1884, the Germans, having
firmly established themselves commercially in the
Samoan Islands, began to definitely and formally
annex territory; the German flag was hoisted
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in the northern part of New Guinea and on
several of the adjacent islands, and the German
"Colony" received the unpromising name of
"Kaiser Wilhelm's Land."</p>

<p>The Australian Colonies immediately lodged
an indignant protest; but arrogance, overglossed
with suavity, carried the day, and a friendly
agreement in regard to New Guinea was made
between Great Britain and Germany in 1885,
whereby the latter assumed administration over
the northern portion of the island, to subjection
of the jurisdiction of which were later added the
Caroline, Palau and Marianne Islands.</p>

<p>"New Britain" undertook the responsibility of
the name "Bismarck Archipelago"; and the principal
island of the group was renamed New-Pommern,
with its capital at Herbertsh&ouml;he.</p>

<p>In 1888 British New Guinea was constituted a
separate Colony, but the administration was, in
1902, placed in the hands of the Commonwealth of
Australia.</p>

<p>Up to 1884 affairs in the islands comprising the
kingdom of Samoa had proceeded along the lines
of progress, and the three nations chiefly concerned
in the Samoan trade (Great Britain, Germany,
and the United States of America) were
conducting commerce without friction until the Germans
felt strong enough to assume an aggressive
attitude, not only towards their trade rivals but also
the native Samoans whose property they coveted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The German influence began to be most markedly
denoted in disaffection amongst the natives and in
inter-tribal wars. It was in 1884, indeed, that the
German pretensions to a say in the administrative
control of Samoa began to be recognised by
Great Britain and the United States as the German
faculty for instigating disputes amongst the
islanders made desirable the institution of some
European control over the native administration.</p>

<p>The affairs of State in Samoa were conducted
under the rule of native kings (two) and chiefs, but
constant feuds and bickerings disturbed the tranquillity
of the islands.</p>

<p>It was really German influence that was the disturbing
element, for inter-tribal strife was fomented
in order that "repressive measures for the establishment
of law and order" on the part of the
Imperial Government might elevate German
prestige.</p>

<p>Apia, the chief town on the principal island of
the Samoan group, Upolu, became the centre of
trade of the eastern South Sea Islands, though its
chief importance to the outside world exists in its
incentive to a distinguished memory. Agreements
were made by the Samoan kings at various dates
with Great Britain, the United States and Germany.
Each of the treaty agreements contained a "most-favoured-nation"
clause, and empowered the
foreign state to form naval stations and coaling
depots at various parts of the island group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>In April, 1885, it was deemed advisable by the
British Government to appoint a Commissioner to
confer with a nominee of the German Government
upon the subject of British and German interests
respectively in such parts of the Western Pacific
Ocean as might be placed by either Government
under its special protection, with a view to recommending
the adoption by both Governments of such
principles as, in the opinion of the Commissioners,
might be applied to better regulate and protect the
interests of their respective subjects, each within
the other's region of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The movement was inaugurated by the German
Government and was the old game successfully
played by Luderitz in South West Africa of applying
to the Imperial German Government for its
"powerful protection" as soon as commercial
interests were well established.</p>

<p>The British Commissioner was Mr Thurston,
who seems to have throughout been altogether
dominated by the German nominee and to have
cheerfully acquiesced in and recommended to our
Government the adoption of every suggestion put
forward by the German Representative.</p>

<p>The Commission, which dealt exclusively with
the position of the three treaty nations in Samoa,
submitted that the existing unsettled state of affairs
in Samoa under the native kings and chiefs was
incompatible with the maintenance of peace and
order and destructive of the best interests both of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the Samoans themselves and of the foreign residents
in the islands, and did not see any hope of
improvement owing to the long-standing feuds and
divisions of the natives.</p>

<p>They recommended, therefore, that a real and
immediate improvement in the social and economical
conditions of Samoa would be best secured
if the administration of the native Government was
assumed by <i>one</i> of the treaty Powers; the sovereignty
of the King of Samoa and the independence
of the islands continuing to be recognised, and due
care being taken by pre-arrangement to secure all
rights justly acquired.</p>

<p>As an alternative, another scheme was submitted
for reconstructing the native Government upon the
general lines of a Crown Colony Government.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the sovereignty of Samoa was
to be permanently confirmed upon King Malietoa
and his heirs, and that a Council of Chiefs (called
the King's Council) should be created to advise
and assist the King in the administration of
government.</p>

<p>Here the German Commissioner showed the
cloven hoof by suggesting that the Council should
consist of eight members: four native Samoans and
four Europeans, of which latter two were to be
nominated by Germany, one by Great Britain, and
one by America.</p>

<p>By virtue of their treaty the Germans set up a
sort of Germano-Samoan Council for the special
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
control of the two principal harbours, Apia and
Saluafata; but the establishment of similar Anglo-Samoan
and Americo-Samoan Councils was hardly
an expedient measure if friction were to be avoided.</p>

<p>The principal object of the Commission was, so
far as Great Britain was concerned, the suppression
of inter-tribal feuds and warfare, to maintain
which the Samoans were bartering away their land
and all other possessions in order to obtain rifles
and ammunition. Dr Krauel, the German Commissioner,
in making the recommendation that the
administration of the native government should be
assumed by one of the treaty Powers, suavely
proposed that "having regard to the great preponderance
of German commercial interests in
Samoa, the task of forming a better administration
should be entrusted, in the first instance, to the
German Government."</p>

<p>On the alternative proposal, Dr Krauel thought
that this commercial preponderance of Germany
should meet recognition by the nomination of two
German representatives as against one each of the
other treaty Powers on the proposed King's Council.</p>

<p>Mr Thurston, the British Commissioner, was
sufficiently impressed with the representations of
his German colleague to suggest to his Government
the adoption of the suggestions, which
meant German control over the whole administration.</p>

<p>Before any action was taken upon the recommendations
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of the Commission, the Germans took
matters into their own hands; and on 31st December,
1885, King Malietoa was driven by a German force
from his seat of Government, and the Samoan
flag hauled down by German forces from a
man-o'-war.</p>

<p>Inquiries elicited the fact that "the object of
the German Representative was not to abolish the
Samoan Government by force, but only to take
reprisals against King Malietoa."</p>

<p>The foundation for the first act of direct aggression
on the part of the Germans seems to have
arisen in the sale of a portion of Apia to an
American, who transferred the deeds to a German&mdash;the
purchase price being only five hundred dollars.
The land was looked on by the Samoans as the
centre of the seat of their Government; and very
rightly, too, as it covered the whole harbour of
Apia.</p>

<p>The King, Malietoa, offered five thousand
dollars to the German holder to rescind the sale,
but was met with a curt refusal of his offer;
following upon which a German proclamation
was immediately issued, drawing attention to
alleged grievances of Germany, <i>more especially in
respect of the violations of treaty agreements</i>, and
declaring the intention of the German Government
to take, in reparation, "possession of the lands of
the village and district of Apia, in which is included
Malinuu (the seat of Government) and the harbour
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of Apia, to hold possession under the supreme
control that was under the Government of Malietoa,
for the Government of Germany."</p>

<p>The Samoans were informed in the proclamation
that it was only the "municipality" that was being
taken possession of, and the document concludes
with a characteristic Hohenzollern touch: "I
beseech you to be at peace and to have confidence
in the Government of Germany and myself. Then
will Samoa indeed be happy!"</p>

<p>An impartial inquiry into the arbitrary action
of the Germans was suggested, but the German
Imperial Government temporised the while a
movement was set on foot by Germans in Samoa
to upset the rule of Malietoa and replace him by
one of their own creatures who had been plentifully
bribed with the two things dearest to the
native&mdash;spirits and firearms.</p>

<p>King Malietoa was informed by the British
Consul that an inquiry was to be held, and that
his kingship could not be jeopardised, the three
Powers, Great Britain, Germany, and America,
having jointly agreed to recognise and maintain
his authority.</p>

<p>To subdue the ardour of the more impetuous
amongst his people, Malietoa issued the following
proclamation to the Chiefs of Samoa:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Chiefs</span>,&mdash;I call upon you to keep quiet, and
not to entertain foolish fears, for the English
Consul, W. Powell, has assured me that in a short
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
time Samoa will be once more united under the
Government of Malietoa, for England does not
undertake anything which she does not carry
through; and all that England undertakes she does
carry through. What Germany does, on the other
hand, is merely commenced, and is not concluded.
Let us place confidence in these words, which will
be fulfilled."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The German Ambassador in London, in discussing
the Samoan question with our own Foreign
Minister, the Earl of Iddlesleigh, referred rather
bitterly to King Malietoa's proclamation, and
Lord Iddlesleigh readily agreed that it was very
offensive.</p>

<p>A further joint Commission was held on the
affairs of Samoa late in the year 1886, in the early
months of which Malietoa had offered to place
Samoa under the protection of the United States&mdash;which
offer was accepted by the American Consul,
but his action immediately repudiated by his
Government.</p>

<p>No workable form of administration could, however,
be agreed upon by the three Powers&mdash;the
reason being that the Germans were determined to
pursue their fixed aim of acquiring the absolute
control of Samoa.</p>

<p>The rule of Malietoa, who had been recognised
in authority by treaty agreements, was irksome to
them; and towards the end of 1887 they demanded
satisfaction from Malietoa for alleged robbery and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
insults to German subjects, whom they declared
had been attacked when returning from celebrating
the birthday of the German Emperor.</p>

<p>The required redress not being forthcoming,
Malietoa was declared deposed by the Germans,
and one Tamasese was set up in his place. The
English and American Consuls did not participate
in the recognition of Tamasese.</p>

<p>A state of anarchy now prevailed for a time; and
inter-tribal combats took place all over the islands,
centring about Apia. An insurrection was engineered
by the Germans which was headed by
Matiafa, who was attacked by Malietoa; and the
opportunity having, as the Germans considered,
arrived for the action of the mailed fist, Germany
declared war on Malietoa.</p>

<p>In March, 1889, relations between the three
Powers became extremely strained in regard to
Samoa, and warships of all the nations concerned
appeared off Apia.</p>

<p>The story of the hurricane that swept the harbour
on the 16th March, in the teeth of which the British
<i>Calliope</i> alone pounded her way out to sea and
safety to the ringing cheers of the American sailors,
is stirringly told in Robert Louis Stevenson's "A
Footnote to History."</p>

<p>The <i>Calliope</i>, fighting the tempest and making
less than a knot an hour, upheld the traditions of
British seamanship; while the ribs of the German
flagship <i>Adler</i> serve the purpose of providing a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
mournful monument to the death of German
ambitions in Samoa.</p>

<p>Until Samoan administrative affairs were finally
settled, her history consists of no more than a
record of squabbles and intrigues.</p>

<p>Every fresh effort only demonstrated more clearly
the futility of control by the three Powers, one
of which was fixed in her determination to be
supreme.</p>

<p>A convention was, indeed, signed at Berlin in
1889 under which the Samoan Islands were declared
to be independent neutral territory, Great Britain,
Germany, and the United States to have equal
rights, and the King Malietoa, who was a strong
opponent of German claims, was again recognised
as King.</p>

<p>Matiafa, who had been stirred into insurrection
for their own purposes by the Germans, now supported
Malietoa, who received a vociferous welcome
from the Samoans on his return to Apia in his
regal capacity.</p>

<p>Shortly after his reinstatement, however,
Malietoa wearied of his office and resigned his
throne, which was no sinecure, in favour of his
friend Matiafa. The latter's election by the people
was necessary; but having duly gone through the
formula, he assumed the sceptre with Malietoa as
"vice-King."</p>

<p>The subordinate position, however, was unsatisfactory
to Malietoa, and by concert of the Powers
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
he was reinstated in his former position&mdash;a proceeding
which Matiafa strongly disapproved of,
and he attacked Malietoa with a strong force.</p>

<p>The Powers again intervened conjointly, and
Matiafa was subdued and deported.</p>

<p>A further rebellion against Malietoa's rule was
suppressed, and the affairs of Samoa began to
present some appearance of law and order when
Mr Henry Ide, an American, was appointed Chief
Justice&mdash;a position of great responsibility. He
seems, however, to have been over-strenuous in
his dispensation of justice, for in less than a year
his repressive measures created a state of Civil
War.</p>

<p>In November, 1894, the unsatisfactory condition
of affairs induced the Government of New Zealand
to come forward with a proposal to establish a Protectorate
over Samoa, and an expressed desire to
undertake the administration of the islands.</p>

<p>The proposal was not entertained by our Home
Government; and while it is probable that such an
arrangement would have met with the approval of
the United States, it is certain that Germany would
have strenuously objected.</p>

<p>Further insurrections in 1894 brought about joint
intervention by Great Britain and Germany, and
the bombardment by ships of the two countries;
while the death of Malietoa in 1898 necessitated
another naval demonstration.</p>

<p>A serious dispute, which might have had far
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
reaching consequences but for the tact displayed
by our Consular Service, arose over the election
of a king to succeed Malietoa. The claimants to
the throne were Tanu, son of Malietoa, and
Matiafa.</p>

<p>In January, 1899, Chief Justice Chambers, an
American, in whose hands the final decision lay,
decided in favour of Tanu in accordance with the
international agreement whereby the throne was
secured to Malietoa and his heirs.</p>

<p>The decision, however, met with the strong disapproval
of the Germans, who instigated Matiafa
to rebel; and a serious outbreak occurred, in the
course of which the greater part of Apia was
burned.</p>

<p>A force of British marines was landed from
H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i>, on which Mr Chambers and
other Europeans took refuge.</p>

<p>A provisional Government was now formed by
Dr Raffel, a German, and President of the Municipal
Court of Apia; and he proclaimed himself
Chief Justice in spite of the protests of the British
and American Consuls.</p>

<p>The Consuls appealed to Captain Sturdee of
the <i>Porpoise</i> to assist in the reinstatement of Mr
Chambers, and he sent ashore a threat to bombard
the town if any resistance were offered to Mr
Chambers in resuming his seat as Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Mr Chambers was opposed by the German
faction, but Dr Raffel's action did not meet with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the approval of the Government at Berlin, and he
was recalled in February, 1899.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Admiral Kantz of the American
navy arrived on the United States cruiser,
<i>Philadelphia</i>, and a proclamation was issued under
which Matiafa's Government was declared to be
illegal under the terms of the Berlin Treaty.</p>

<p>A counter-proclamation was immediately issued
by the German Consul, Herr Rose, the immediate
result of which was that Apia was surrounded by
a strong force of rebels, and riots occurred&mdash;in the
course of which R. L. Stevenson's house was
looted.</p>

<p>The British and American warships opened
fire and landed forces of bluejackets, who, after
some severe fighting and losses, repulsed the
rebels.</p>

<p>On the 23rd March, 1899, Tanu was crowned
King of the Samoan Islands in the presence of
the Foreign Consuls, with the exception of the
Representative of the German Government.</p>

<p>Matiafa, with German moral support, continued
in rebellion, and several Anglo-American parties
of bluejackets and marines were ambuscaded,
though the chief rebels' posts were captured.</p>

<p>A state of anarchy now prevailed, and another
international Commission was appointed in May,
1899, Mr Bartlett Tripp (President) representing
the United States, Mr Eliot Great Britain, and
Baron Sternburg Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Chambers' decision was confirmed by the
Commission, but Tanu had wearied of his kingship
and voluntarily abdicated.</p>

<p>Further fighting now occurred, but an agreement
was signed in August, 1899, by the three
Powers, under which the kingship was abolished
and the Government of Samoa placed in the hands
of an Administrator with a Council of the Consuls
of Great Britain, Germany, and the United States,
assisted by a native assembly and a High Court
of Justice.</p>

<p>The German, Dr Solf, Municipal President,
was nominated as Administrator, and Mr
Osborne, the United States Consul, was appointed
to act as Chief Justice in the place of Mr
Chambers who had resigned.</p>

<p>Samoa remained under this triple administration
until the 1st March, 1900, when by the Anglo-German
Convention, embodied in the Samoa
Treaty, the principal Samoan Islands were
annexed by Germany, the Tonga, Savage, and
Solomon Islands came under the rule of Great
Britain, while Tutuila and the adjacent islands
became the property of the United States.</p>

<p>On the 1st March, 1900, the German flag was
hoisted over Apia.</p>

<p>Claims for compensation were presented for the
destruction of property during the Matiafa rebellion;
and these, having been submitted to the
arbitration of the King of Sweden, were, in 1902,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
adjudged to be payable by Great Britain and the
United States of America!</p>

<p>The surrender of Samoa to Germany was a
bitter pill to New Zealand, and the Imperialist
Premier, the late "Dick" Seddon, expressed
himself forcibly on the subject.</p>

<p>In reply to the letter from the Imperial Colonial
Secretary announcing British withdrawal from
Samoa, Seddon, who had looked to the realisation
of the dream of a federation of the Pacific Islands
under the hegemony of New Zealand, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3">"This surrender of Samoa will in future be a
source of anxiety and entail expense on Great
Britain and the Colonies in preparing for and
providing against eventualities. However, now
that it has been done, it is necessary that immediately
opportune steps should be taken to put the
islands admitted to be British on a satisfactory
footing. Some definite action of a forward character
is required in the Pacific at the earliest
opportune moment, for the surrender of Samoa
has disheartened the natives in the islands,
disappointed the people of Australasia, and lowered
the prestige of Great Britain in this part of the
world."</p>
</blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Samoa</span></h3>

<p>The thought of South Sea Islands conjures up
pictures of treasure-trove and pearls, of joy-rides
on turtle back, of dusky beauties with scarlet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
hybiscus blooms in their hair, and of fat, naked
brown babies rolling on the sun-kissed sands.</p>

<p>Readers of Robert Louis Stevenson will know
Samoa and the Samoans as he knew them, and
will picture the life on the islands he loved&mdash;gentle
and entrancing&mdash;and breathe the soft atmosphere
undisturbed save by the gurgle of rivulets flinging
spray, on which small rainbows dance, over lichen-covered
boulders flanked by feathery tree ferns.</p>

<p>Samoa, Upolu, Fanuatapu&mdash;the very sound of
the names has in it the cadence of the murmur
of the surf over coral reefs and silver sands, or
the whisper of perfume-laden breezes in tall palms
fringing blue lagoons.</p>

<p>That is the more aesthetic conception; but there
is a sordid view open to the imagination in blood-spattered,
headless corpses, victims of tribal fights,
or "the white men on the beach," in turn victims
of unbridled passions and "square-face" gin.</p>

<p>The beachcombers of the South Seas have
enriched the slang of our language with the
expression "on the beach," or "on the pebbly,"
to denote a hopeless financial condition; but as
a class these pyjama-clad, unlaced-booted gentry
represent the limit of degradation&mdash;the bottom of
the depths.</p>

<p>To natives all white men are chiefs, but "surely
these are not great chiefs?" asked one of the
Samoan islanders, indicating the whites who dream
the idle hours away on the sandy beach of Samoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Papua, or New Guinea, again, is in the mind
immediately associated with fearsome weapons of
warfare made of carved wood, with collections
of smoke-dried human heads with fantastically
tattooed faces, and horrid feasts at which the <i>pi&egrave;ce
de r&eacute;sistance</i> was sirloin of "methody" missionary.</p>

<p>The Samoan Islands are perfect in their beauty,
and all the conditions, including the ease with
which the bare necessaries of life were produced
from natural resources, conduced to a <i>dolce far
niente</i> sort of existence amongst the natives, by
which the whites also became infected.</p>

<p>The Samoan group, which forms the entrep&ocirc;t
of all the islands round where trade is carried
on, consists of fourteen islands, of which eight,
Savaii, Manono, Apolima, Upolu, Fanuatapu,
Manua, Nu'utele, and Nu'ulua, were German&mdash;the
remainder being British and American.</p>

<p>Savaii is roughly 50 miles long by 10 miles wide,
comprising some 650 square miles; while Upolu,
22 miles east of Savaii, comprises about 340 square
miles.</p>

<p>All the islands are of volcanic origin, and rise
to rugged elevations; while they are surrounded
by coral reefs intersected by passages through
which the navigation is difficult and dangerous.
Savaii, rising to 5,400 feet, possesses an active
volcano; Upolu reaches an elevation of 3,200 feet;
while Tutuila, separated from Upolu by a channel
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
36 miles in width, is 2,300 feet at its highest
point.</p>

<p>On all the islands there is a certain scarcity of
fresh water inland, but it is plentiful on the lower
slopes and above high-water mark on the seashore.</p>

<p>While the climate is moist, it is never excessively
hot; and the fertility of the soil is such that it is
almost a drawback, for the extreme productiveness
of the soil obviates the necessity for strenuous
labour on the part of anyone who occupies a patch
of ground whereon to grow cocoa-nuts, yams, etc.</p>

<p>On the Island Upolu, R. L. Stevenson's home,
is Apia, the port and centre of Samoan trade. At
Apia Stevenson died on the 5th December, 1894.
He was much loved by the Samoans, and was by
them buried on the top of Vasa Mountain, 1,300 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>Saluafata is the next harbour of importance; but
both Apia and Saluafata are open harbours, and
during the months of January, February, and
March are particularly insecure, owing to the
hurricanes which prevail.</p>

<p>The Samoan Islands contain less than 600 white
inhabitants, and the native population is a little
over 40,000. The natives residing on Upolu
amount to 18,000, and on Savaii 13,000; while
imported labourers total about 1,500.</p>

<p>The origin of the natives is obscure, but ethnological
students have declared them to be closely
allied to the Maoris of New Zealand, and to have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
their origin in China; and there seems to be no
reason to doubt their judgment.</p>

<p>While cannibalism was prevalent throughout the
islands of the South Seas, its practice has always
been denied by the Samoans.</p>

<p>By nature the Samoan natives are indolent, and
would look upon any uncalled-for exertion as a
midsummer madness; while, to the Samoan mind,
the idea of growing food such as cocoa-nuts, etc.,
for the purpose of sending it away and selling it,
held about it something barbaric, unhandsome,
and absurd. There is for him no conceivable
object in growing anything more than is necessary
to provide daily food, and consequently he
would have no share nor parcel in such a practice.</p>

<p>The question of labour, therefore, has always
been a pressing one on the plantations; and to
provide this Chinese have been imported under
indentures, and by Chinese labour all the work is
carried on.</p>

<p>From the time of their first gaining a footing in
Samoa, the Germans began to oust the natives from
the land; and as the Samoans could not be got to
work, plantations were established under German
managers who proceeded to extract from it, by
means of the cheapest foreign labour procurable,
as much as it would yield.</p>

<p>At Apia, which Stevenson describes as the seat
of the political sickness of Samoa, a controlling
German firm was established who gradually
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
obtained possession of the most fertile lands, but
their titles were at times of the flimsiest.</p>

<p>The same writer describes how a visitor would
observe, near an ancient Samoan village which he
had been informed was the proper residence of the
Samoan kings, a notice-board set up indicating that
the historic village was the property of the German
firm. These boards, he adds, which were among
the commonest features of the landscape, might be
rather taken to imply that the claim had been
disputed.</p>

<p>If the "sales" of land from the natives to the
German firm were questionable, the Samoans beheld
in the firm only the occupier of <i>their</i> land, and
consequently regarded the constant raiding of the
German plantations and the stealthy gathering of
the cocoa-nuts merely in the light of a very trifling
peccadillo, and certainly not as theft.</p>

<p>Such land as the firm was unable to find labour
to work was "mortgaged" to natives, who were
compelled, under a penalty of imprisonment, to
sell their copra to no one except to the mortgagee.
The firm, which Stevenson describes as "the true
centre of trouble, the head of the boil," of which
Samoa languished thus gradually, got into its own
hands the practical monopoly of trade.</p>

<p>The trade of the islands of the South Pacific was,
as previously stated, always regarded in Europe as
a most valuable one; and when in 1711 a monopoly
of trade with South America and the Pacific Islands
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was granted to the South Sea Company in England,
its riches were popularly looked upon as illimitable
and the shares of the South Sea Company stood at
one time at a premium of 900 per cent.</p>

<p>The bursting of the "South Sea Bubble," however,
was the end of monopolies until the era of the
German firm, whose agents gained a preponderance
even in Fiji.</p>

<p>The principal article of Samoan trade is copra,
and the value of land is assessed according to its
growth of cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>The trade was eminently suited for Germans, as
the natives readily bartered for cheap and flashy
goods "made in Germany."</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Apia uncultivated land is worth
from &pound;15 to &pound;25 an acre, and cultivated land
planted with cocoa-nuts from &pound;20 to &pound;40; while
"bush" land faced a value ranging from 8s.
to &pound;2.</p>

<p>In addition to palm-oil and copra, Samoa
yields the usual tropical products of cocoa, coffee,
tobacco and rubber, as well as vegetable ivory.</p>

<p>From Samoa the export of copra in 1912
amounted to &pound;200,000, and owing to the increased
utility found for copra and its steady rise in price
during recent years, further planting has energetically
proceeded, though somewhat interfered
with by the appearance of the rhinoceros beetle.</p>

<p>The pest seems to have been introduced in
baskets of earth in which rubber stumps were
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
packed, and soon obtained a firm hold upon the
plantations, though the Samoan Government has
made strenuous efforts to extirpate it.</p>

<p>"The larvae usually proceeding from eggs
deposited in decayed cocoa-nut stumps are found
in large quantities six to twelve inches beneath
the soil, in masses of rubbish, where they gradually
transform themselves into beetles. On coming
to the surface they fly from tree to tree and
feed on the leaves, especially on the centre leaf of
the cocoa-nut palm&mdash;the heart of the tree&mdash;which,
being eaten up, the tree dies. The eggs, it is
said, are always deposited by the beetles above
the ground, and turn into caterpillars, which,
boring their way through loose soil and rubbish,
then become larvae."<a id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Rubber is of comparatively recent introduction
into Samoan production, and only amounted to
&pound;646 in 1911.</p>

<p>Tapping really only commenced in that year;
and though later figures are not available all
reports as regards the quality of Samoan rubber
are reassuring, and the prospects of the industry
are regarded as excellent.</p>

<p>Cocoa, however, has been grown for many
years, and in 1911 was exported to the value
of &pound;38,508, despite the ravages of the "cacao
canker," which attacks the older trees, the young
ones under eight or nine years old being seldom
if ever affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst other industries is the collection of
phosphates, the value of which, exported from
the Pacific Islands in 1912, amounted to &pound;250,000.</p>

<p>The following official report was made last year
on the phosphate industry in the islands of Nauru
and Angaur:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Pacific Phosphate Company in 1912
shipped from the islands 138,000 tons (as against
90,000 tons in the previous year). The Company
suffered from a gradually growing lack of
labourers, which was in the end overcome by
the importation of coolies. At the end of 1912,
59 Europeans, 90 Chinese, and 576 natives of the
Protectorate were employed in the phosphate
mines on the Island of Nauru. The works were
improved and extended in many directions. The
Deutsche Suedsee Phosphat Aktiengesellschaft
exported from Angaur 54,000 tons of phosphate,
as against 45,000 tons in the previous year. The
total annual production has consequently increased
by 57,000 tons. While on Nauru Island labour
was scarce, on Angaur several plants had to be
finished before work could proceed to the full
extent. Labour conditions were here satisfactory."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The imports to Samoa are principally cheap
"trade goods," and include large quantities of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
calico, petticoats of which are worn by both men
and women. The latter purchase white dress-stuff
and have them printed by native dyers with a
dye known as tapa.</p>

<p>The value of imports in 1911 totalled &pound;203,312.</p>

<p>Galvanised iron has grown more and more in
demand, the wild sugar-cane disease having
nearly destroyed the manufacture of the picturesque
native thatch.</p>

<p>New Zealand and Australia have a regularly
connecting line of steamers, and in 1913 a better
connection was provided for the whole South Sea
District (by the Germans of course) by a steamship
line from Singapore which touched New Guinea
as well as Samoa.</p>

<p>The South Seas have for many decades been
the field of fruitful labour of missionaries, and as
a result of their work in their native schools every
Samoan can read and write his own language.
The Government had a school for white and half-caste
children at Upolu in which they were taught
English.</p>

<p>After annexing Samoa the Germans established
a Government, taking the form of a Government
Council, consisting, besides the members who
occupied official positions, of eight persons
selected by the Governor, and who were chosen
from the leading merchants and planters. The
votes of the general public as regards the
election of these were presented to the Governor
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
for his information, but he was not compelled to
act in accordance with them&mdash;the votes merely
indicating the popular wish in the matter. Up to
1912 two councillors, who received no salary, were
Englishmen but subsequently all were German.</p>

<p>The Germans took steps to get rid of "the
white men on the beach," and the class of white
who dreamed the hours away there were discouraged
by a deposit of &pound;25, or a guarantee for
that amount, being required to be placed in the
hands of the collector of customs before strangers
from foreign countries could land, unless they
intended leaving again by the next or following
steamer.</p>

<p>Up to December, 1912, pleading by foreigners
in the Imperial Court in Apia was allowed in the
English language by persons who could not
speak German, but this was then stopped and
all Court proceedings were held in the German
language, or, where those concerned could not
speak German, by means of an interpreter.
Interpreters were provided by the Court for
witnesses, but not for parties to suits nor for
anyone appearing for them. In the custom-house
and post office, however, English was still
permitted.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Government was extremely anxious to
increase the use of the German language in
Samoa, but as regarded trade and commerce the
proximity of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
caused the knowledge of English to be of far
more importance to the residents, whatever their
nationality.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Guinea</span></h3>

<p>The New Guinea (formerly known as Papua)
group of islands comprise Melanesia, the Samoan
being included in Polynesia.</p>

<p>In New Guinea the British territory was in 1914
approximately 87,786 square miles, while the
German possessions in the north of the principal
island, and including the Bismarck Archipelago,
amounted to roughly 180,000 square miles.</p>

<p>German New Guinea was, upon the hoisting of
the German flag, renamed Kaiser Wilhelm's Land,
New Britain became Neu Pommern, and New
Ireland took the name of Neu Mecklenburg.</p>

<p>Neu Pommern and Neu Mecklenburg are the
principal islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, the
area of which is estimated at 48,000 square miles.</p>

<p>Lying in the equatorial region, the climate of
New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago is hot
and humid, and the seasons may be roughly
divided into the comparatively dry period of the
southeast monsoon from about May to November,
and the rainy west or north-west monsoon.</p>

<p>The annual rainfall is heavy, being some 150
inches on the sea-board, and far more on the highlands
which intercept the moisture-laden clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the majority of the islands of the South
Seas, New Guinea coastal districts are infested with
mosquitoes, and malarial fever, which affects Europeans
as well as natives, is prevalent. It occurs
in more or less severe forms, and occasionally terminates
fatally. The eradication of the mosquito
pest by petroleum spraying, which has proved such
a marked success in the Panama regions, is now
being attempted in all malarial-stricken countries,
and will, when accomplished, no doubt bring
immunity from malaria to New Guinea.</p>

<p>The coastline on the mainland of New Guinea is
fringed by coral reefs and a line of large and small
islands, and is indented by fine bays; but to reach
them the navigation is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>In the narrow passages between the islands and
between the reefs the current is so strong and runs
so continuously for days at a time that a sailing boat
can do nothing but lie at anchor waiting for
a turn in the tide, and some have had to wait for
a fortnight before they could get through.</p>

<p>The chief danger to navigation is the number of
coral reefs that are scattered about the coast, very
few of them charted. Sometimes there is enough
water to make it safe to pass over them, and then
the coral presents a beautiful sight&mdash;snow-white
with long branches, or bright-red: then the sudden
drop into deep, dark nothingness, at the edge of
the reef that rises sheer from bottomless depths.</p>

<p>The islands are volcanic and the Kaiser Wilhelm
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
territory in particular is very mountainous, the
most prominent feature of its configuration, especially
on the east coast, being the magnificent
mountain ranges which in places rise steeply from
the narrow fringe of the low coastal lands.</p>

<p>Snow-capped mountains and volcanoes, rising
to a height of 15,000 feet or more, are reported to
have been seen in the interior, which is still considerably
unexplored.</p>

<p>There are a large number of mountain streams
on all the large islands, but so far no navigable
river has been found in the Archipelago.</p>

<p>An abundant rainfall, together with a high and
equable temperature, has produced a vegetation of
exceptional luxuriance and great variety. While
in places extensive areas of grass plains are found,
the hillsides and lowlands are, for the greater part,
covered with almost impenetrable forest, containing
timber trees of considerable size and utilitarian
value.</p>

<p>Manioc (wild arrowroot), yams, bananas, and
other tropical fruit such as paw-paws are cultivated
by the natives, while sago forms a staple food of
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Sago palms grow wild in the bush, and prior to
treatment sago is, like tapioca, in its crude state
poisonous; but the Papuans have devised the means
of carefully preparing the pith of the palm, and by
washing, straining, and drying rendered it fit for
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Until the end of the flowering period, the hollow
interior of the sago palm, somewhat similar to
bamboo, is filled with a starchy mass from which
the growing fruit draws its nourishment. The tree
is felled by the Papuans and the pulp scraped and
washed, during which process the sago is separated
and sinks to the bottom.</p>

<p>Cocoa-nuts also form an important food factor,
and groves are found everywhere; while copra and
palm-oil are the principal articles of trade.</p>

<p>Papuan birds are noted, and amongst the numerous
species of bird life the bird of paradise is
particularly notable for richness of plumage; and
the skins of bright-plumaged birds have been in the
past extensively exported.</p>

<p>New Guinea holds less than 500 white inhabitants,
the majority being, of course, German
officials and planters; while the natives living in
all the islands are estimated at 500,000.</p>

<p>Papua suffered for years from the presence of
the undesirable "white men on the beach," and
wild and weird tales are told of early days of white
men with nothing to do, sitting or lying about in
native houses.</p>

<p>The Rev. Henry Newton, one of the pioneers of
later civilisation in British New Guinea, gives the
following description of a phase of New Guinea life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The storekeeper would go to bed and leave a
supply of liquor handy for his clients to dispose of
as seemed best to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"They would spend the night drinking and
gambling, the empty bottles thrown over the
veranda would form a fine heap on the ground,
and sometimes one or two humans would follow
the bottles as the result of a heated but disconnected
argument, and decide to remain there till
the morning. The storekeeper and publican would
count up the number of 'dead-heads' in the
morning, and divide the total cost amongst those
whom he had left to enjoy themselves overnight.</p>

<p>"A gaol was built for the accommodation of
native prisoners; not that this meant there was no
need of a place of detention for members of the
white race. Occasionally a white man had to be
accommodated.</p>

<p>"One man, an Irishman, who had been indulging
not wisely but too well and had decided on
open-air treatment, was lying asleep in the street,
and it was necessary to remove him. A detachment
of native police was told off to carry the
member of the ruling race to the gaol.</p>

<p>"When they had hoisted him on their shoulders
and were marching off, the unhappy man waked
up for a moment, and, not quite understanding the
situation, said 'Hullo, boys, what have I done?
Why, am I a hero?'"<a id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The native Papuans are not regarded as suitable
for work in the Western sense of the word, and the
German efforts to exploit the natives have not
produced very successful economic results, and the
import of Chinese coolies had to be relied on. This
resulted, in the Pacific Islands generally, in a traffic
in labour which roused R. L. Stevenson's ire.</p>

<p>The native inhabitants consist in New Guinea of
a number of races, differing totally from each other
in appearance, customs, and language.</p>

<p>The various tribes have little in common with
each other, and inter-tribal wars and feuds have
been continuous, in the course of which the custom
of "head-hunting" became a popular pastime.</p>

<p>Although the Samoans strenuously repudiate the
suggestion that they or their ancestors were ever
addicted to cannibalism, the Papuans freely admit
the prevalence of the custom; and although they
now profess to have discontinued cannibalism, the
older men will talk confidentially about the doings
in "the old days," and will sigh for the times that
have been.</p>

<p>The natives have unbounded belief in the powers
of sorcerers and in witchcraft, and are more easily
held in control by superstition than by any appeal
to any sense.</p>

<p>The hard work&mdash;domestic and agricultural&mdash;is
done by the women, as amongst most native races;
it being beneath a man's dignity to be engaged in
any other labour than that connected with warfare,
sport, or the provision of creature comforts.</p>

<p>The Government of New Guinea was vested in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Governor whose seat was at Herbertsh&ouml;he, picturesquely
situated on the shores of Neu
Pommern. The town was the most important
commercial centre of the Colony, several of the
principal trading and planting firms making it
their headquarters. Round about it are situated
some of the best cocoa-nut plantations in the
islands.</p>

<p>The official language was, of course, German,
but English was also spoken or at least understood
by all European residents in the islands.</p>

<p>In the intercourse with the natives the weird form
of speech known as pidgin-English is in universal
use throughout the South Seas. It is framed on
the same principles as their own languages, and
every white man who cannot speak native seems to
fall naturally into the use of it. So universal is its
use that in German New Guinea the Government
officials, to the offence of their <i>kultured</i> minds, had
to use it if they wanted the natives to understand
them.</p>

<p>In their anxiety to spread the use of German,
this must have been particularly distasteful to the
officials, especially when an Englishman who did
not understand German found a medium in pidgin-English.</p>

<p>Some compensation, however, is found by a
German writer who says that "<i>although</i> it is
deplorable that, while the easily learned Malay
language might be introduced with advantage,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
this unlovely dog-English should still be encouraged,
the quaint expressions promptly invited by
the natives for anything new to them, amply
demonstrate their ready wit and furnish a constant
source of amusement."</p>

<p>But if "pidgin" is a barbarous perversion of
English, on the other hand pidgin-German is a
horror hardly conceivable.</p>

<p>Of all the island groups in the Pacific Ocean,
perhaps none offers conditions equally favourable
for agricultural pursuits than does the north coast
of New Guinea and the Archipelago. Lying outside
the cyclonic belt, those devastating storms
which are largely responsible for the failure of
crops in Polynesia, as well as in some of the groups
north of the line, need not be reckoned with, and a
greater fertility of the soil further helps to make
this part of the Pacific well fitted for tropical
cultivation.</p>

<p>Cocoa-nut growing especially proves most profitable,
but cotton, rubber, cocoa, coffee, and tobacco
are also grown, besides spices and fruits.</p>

<p>The export of copra, which in 1912 amounted to
&pound;300,000, has steadily increased as more and more
land was brought under cultivation. Other articles
of export include phosphates, pearl and tortoiseshell,
trepang, sandal-wood, and vegetable ivory.</p>

<p>The exportation of phosphates in 1912 amounted
to about &pound;250,000, and with copra made up 90 per
cent of the exports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Skins of birds of paradise were exported from
Kaiser Wilhelm's Land in 1912 to the value of
&pound;25,000, but an agitation on hand against the
destruction of wild birds for the sake of their
plumage will no doubt put an end to this
traffic.</p>

<p>Trepang or b&ecirc;che-de-mer, otherwise known as
sea cucumbers and sea slugs, are an important food
luxury amongst the Chinese and other Eastern
people. They are used in the gelatinous soups
which form an important article of food in China.
They are prepared for export by being lightly
boiled, then sun-dried, and finally smoked over a
fire. A small English company is engaged in the
industry of trepang fishing.</p>

<p>While timber of great variety and excellent
quality exists in inexhaustible quantities, and
although there are small saw-mills in Kaiser
Wilhelm's Land, only small quantities of timber
for cabinet purposes have been exported.</p>

<p>Traces of valuable minerals have been discovered.
In 1890 gold was located by prospectors
from Queensland, but the gold veins discovered
have not proved as valuable as had been hoped.</p>

<p>Oil has also been prospected in New Guinea,
but its exploitation was reserved by the German
Government. The analysis showed a high percentage
of heavy oil.</p>

<p>The imports, amounting in 1912 to &pound;750,000,
consist chiefly of food-stuffs, liquid and tinned,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
machinery and iron ware, building materials,
clothing, leathern goods, and sundries.</p>

<p>The wants of the natives are few, however, and
little trade is done with them in textiles, the
clothing of men and women alike being usually
composed of strips of cloth with plaited grass
girdles and a profusion of shell ornaments.</p>

<p>On 15th August, 1914, the advanced detachment
of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, which
was ordered to seize Samoa, left Wellington at
dawn and was met at sea by three of His Britannic
Majesty's cruisers in New Zealand waters&mdash;the
<i>Psyche</i>, the <i>Pyramus</i>, and the <i>Philomel</i>.</p>

<p>As it was known that the German armoured
cruisers <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> were at large
in the Pacific, it was decided not to go direct to
Samoa, but to shape a course for New Caledonia
(French).</p>

<p>Cruising off New Caledonia the British ships
were joined by the French cruiser <i>Montcalm</i> and
by the Australian cruisers <i>Australia</i> and <i>Melbourne</i>.</p>

<p>The contingent received a wonderfully enthusiastic
reception from the French in New Caledonia,
and under the command of Admiral Sir G. E.
Patey the allied fleet steamed for Samoa.</p>

<p>In the early dawn of 30th August the first
glimpse was obtained of Upolu&mdash;the scene of wars
and rebellions and international schemings, and
the scene also of that devastating hurricane which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wrecked six ships of war and ten other vessels and
sent 142 officers and men of the German and
American navies to their last sleep.</p>

<p>The rusting ribs and plates of the <i>Adler</i>, the
German flagship, pitched high inside the reef,
stared at them as a reminder of that memorable
event.</p>

<p>The <i>Psyche</i> went on ahead, and after the
harbour had been swept for mines, she steamed in
under a flag of truce and delivered a message from
Rear-Admiral Sir George Patey demanding surrender.
The Germans, who had been expecting
their own fleet in, were surprised at the suddenness
with which an overwhelming force had
descended upon them, and decided to offer no
resistance to a landing.</p>

<p>In a remarkably brief space of time the covering
party was on shore, and shortly afterwards Apia
was swarming with British bluejackets and troops.
Guards were placed all about the Government
buildings and a staff installed in the Government
offices.</p>

<p>The custom-house was seized and an armed
party was dispatched along a bush road to seize
the wireless station, the tall, latticed iron mast of
which could be seen rising above the trees some
three or four miles inland on the lower slopes of
the hills.</p>

<p>Meantime the German flag that had flown over
the island for fourteen years was hauled down,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the Germans present doffing their hats and standing
bareheaded and silent on the veranda of the
Supreme Court as they watched the soldier in
khaki from New Zealand unceremoniously pulling
it down, detaching it from the rope, and carrying
it inside the building.</p>

<p>Next morning the British flag was hoisted with
all due ceremony. The troops were drawn up in
three sides of a square facing the court-house&mdash;the
seat of the new Government. Inside the square
and facing the flagstaff were Colonel Logan and
staff in their rough khaki uniforms, with them the
naval Commanders. On the left the high Samoan
Chiefs, Tanu-Malietoa and Tamasese&mdash;who had
been specially invited to attend the ceremony&mdash;with
other Chiefs made a picturesque group.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago some of those present had
seen the young Chief Tanu placed on the throne
of Malietoa, with the representatives of the allied
fleets of Great Britain and America and the civil
authorities of these natives in attendance, and the
Germans conspicuous only by their absence.</p>

<p>A few minutes before 8 o'clock all was ready.
The commands to the troops had ceased and an
intense silence had prevailed. Two bluejackets
and a naval lieutenant stood, with the flag, awaiting
the signal.</p>

<p>Presently the first gun of the Royal salute from
the <i>Psyche</i> boomed out across the bay. Then
slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, to the booming
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of twenty-one guns the flag was hoisted, the
officers with drawn swords silently watching it
go up.</p>

<p>With the sound of the last gun the flag reached
the top of the flagstaff and fluttered out in the southeast
trade wind above the tall palms of Upolu.</p>

<p>The troops came to the Royal salute as the band
played the National Anthem.</p>

<p>The reading of a proclamation by Colonel Logan
terminated the brief but finely impressive ceremonial.</p>

<p>The German Governor, Dr Schutz, was sent to
Fiji and subsequently to New Zealand.</p>

<p>With similar ceremonies Herbertsh&ouml;he in Neu
Pommern was occupied by an Australian force.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 14th September the German cruisers
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> made their appearance
at Apia, but on the New Zealanders manning
the guns the ships left for the open Pacific.</p>

<p>A German merchant ship was at the time at
Pango-Pango in the American island of Tutuila,
and ten members of the crew deserted and rowed
the seventy miles to Apia, where they hoped to
find the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>. They were,
however, arrested by the British authorities.</p>

<p class="pmb3">A British administration was set up. The
German officials in the old administration resigned
their appointments, but the natives decided to
continue under British rule.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br /><br />

<span class="font08">KIAU-CHAU</span></h2>


<p>In their various "voyages of discovery" and
enterprises to extend their trading operations, it
was inevitable that the European nations should
endeavour to find an opening into China.</p>

<p>From being a dreaded volcano whence streams
of lava in the shape of devastating hordes constantly
overflowed to upset the ideas of culture as
conceived by the nations who radiated the principles
of "civilisation" in succession to the fallen
Empires of Greece and Rome, China had retired
into a seclusion, only to be disturbed when "Progress"
knocked at her doors.</p>

<p>She shut herself in and literally walled her
borders, not so much to keep out invasion but to
retain for herself and her people her stoical civilisation
and the secrets in the arts and crafts of which
she was the sole possessor; for Chinese internal
affairs concerned no one but herself and her people,
and her peculiar industries were conducted and
perpetuated on an apprentice system&mdash;father to son
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
handing down by word of mouth the methods of
success in the various arts.</p>

<p>As European nations rose and fell&mdash;as the
grandeur that was Spain succeeded the glittering
adventures of Portuguese navigators, as the Dutch,
French, and British struggled for mastery on the
outer seas, and while Europe resounded with
the stern music of the tramp of Napoleon's
legions, China, with her centuries of arrested
civilisation, maintained an inscrutable attitude,
and, slumbering in brooding silence, preserved
her aloofness from any interest without her
borders.</p>

<p>The wave of European trade-expansion surged
high upon her barrier of inclusiveness before she
awoke to what was to her a new era&mdash;the age in
which man might demand for man equable treatment
in the way of trade, upon a basis in the
constitution of which China had no experience and
no say.</p>

<p>Hitherto China's conception of outer trade was
merely the collection of tribute, and her first association
with trade with the "foreign devils" from
the outer world was quite in conformity with that
idea, for her piratical junks set out and joyously
exacted toll indiscriminately.</p>

<p>But this was hardly the legitimate form intended
by the merchants of the West, and compensation
for the misconceived acts of her subjects being
demanded, China was invited to subscribe to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
treaties which might open her doors to the introduction
of more cultured methods of barter.</p>

<p>Unreluctantly, however, as China assented to the
development of trade by foreign nations in her
seas and along her coasts, for many years the
severest possible restrictions were placed upon
Chinese leaving their country for the purpose of
trade.</p>

<p>"Treaties" were concluded with the Western
nations for the sake of peace, but by the Chinese
in general these treaties were regarded as mere
subterfuges whereby to disarm the vigilance of the
prey.</p>

<p>Treaties for the furtherance of trade were entered
into with the Western nations in turn from the
end of the seventeenth century onwards, but none
of these entailed any territorial concessions nor
threatened "the integrity of China."</p>

<p>The thin end of the German wedge seems to have
been inserted into Chinese affairs by the conclusion
of a secret treaty in 1880 between Germany
and China, whereby the latter, who was ready to
grant or promise any manner of concession in
return for being left alone, gave Germany trading
privileges, which she had already granted to other
nations. But Germany's influence in China was
nil until after the Chino-Japanese War of 1894.</p>

<p>Russia, owing to her geographical position and
to the intercourse of her subjects with the Chinese,
was chiefly interested in China, and the Taiping
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Rebellion of 1850 firmly established France and
Great Britain in the exclusive Empire.</p>

<p>In 1894 war broke out between China and Japan,
which resulted in a complete and decisive victory
for the latter.</p>

<p>Peace was signed by Li Hung Chang on behalf
of China at Shimonoseki on the 17th April, 1895,
and the European nations realised at its conclusion
that in Japan a new Power had arisen in the Far
East, and that the beginning of a new epoch had
begun.</p>

<p>The Peace Treaty entered into between Japan and
China in 1895 provided, for the absolute independence
of Korea which had been a vassal of China
since 1882, the cession to Japan of the Island of
Formosa and the Liao-tung Peninsula at the foot
of which lies Port Arthur (which was then occupied
by the Japanese), and the payment of an indemnity
of &pound;30,000,000, pending the handing over of which
Japan was to occupy the Port of Wei-hai-wei on
the Shantung Peninsula.</p>

<p>A further condition of the treaty was the opening
of certain places to foreign enterprise and
commerce.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this treaty brought the European
Powers on the scene.</p>

<p>For some time Russia had been intent upon the
problem of securing an ice-clear port on the Pacific
Ocean as an outlet to her Siberian possessions&mdash;an
ambition which was considered by British statesmen
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
as not unreasonable&mdash;and therefore the occupation
by Japan of all the coastline of Korea by no
means suited Russia. She, therefore, invited the
intervention of the Powers, and the invitation was
accepted by France and Germany, but declined by
Great Britain.</p>

<p>A joint note was then presented to the Tokio
Government by Russia, France and Germany,
under which Japan was recommended not to occupy
any of the Chinese mainland permanently.</p>

<p>The Japanese, finding this force arrayed against
them, stated that they "yielded to the dictates of
magnanimity, and accepted the advice of the three
Powers."</p>

<p>Japan gave up the whole of her continental
acquisitions under the war, and retained only Formosa;
so the "integrity of China" seemed to be
preserved for the time.</p>

<p>The Japanese people were shocked at this incident.
The attitude of Russia and France they
could understand, but Germany, who had been
worming her way into Japan's good graces by
professions of friendship and who was wholly uninterested
in the ownership of Manchuria, seemed to
have joined in robbing Japan of the fruits of her
victorious war merely to establish a title to Russia's
goodwill, and to renew the good relations with
Russia which had been broken by the Franco-Russian
<i>entente</i> of the years 1891-1895.</p>

<p>In pursuit of her aim of an outlet to Siberia,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Russia assisted China in the payment of the
Japanese war indemnity, and obtained the right to
carry the Siberian railway to Vladivostock, this
giving her a grasp on Northern Manchuria. By a
secret arrangement with Germany, Russia subsequently
obtained a "lease" of the Liao-tung
Peninsula, giving the assurance that Port Arthur
would be an "open port" for the trade of all
nations; but as it transpired that Port Arthur was unsuited
to mercantile trade, it became solely a naval
base and the "open port" was established at Dalny.</p>

<p>On the 20th June, 1895, France entered into a
convention with China under which she obtained
certain railway and mining rights in Kiang-si and
Yun-nan, and the signing of this convention
brought China into conflict with Great Britain.</p>

<p>Great Britain could hardly regard with equanimity
the growth of Russian influence in the
north; she therefore demanded and obtained a
lease of Wei-hai-wei on the Shantung Peninsula,
occupied Wei-hai-wei immediately upon its
evacuation by the Japanese, and threw the port open
to outside trade.</p>

<p>In the meantime Germany considered that she
had received no reward for her share in supporting
France and Russia in compelling the retrocession
of Liao-tung; in fact China could not be brought
to see that Germany's place in "world politics"
entitled her to annex any portion of the Chinese
Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>On 1st November, 1897, however, two Roman
Catholic missionaries, who were German subjects,
were most conveniently murdered near Kiau-Chau,
and, ostensibly to get compensation for this outrage
on German <i>kultur</i>, Germany proceeded to
seize Kiau-Chau.</p>

<p>This port was claimed by Russia, but on the face
of it the synchronical cession of Port Arthur to
Russia points to the two countries having come
to an arrangement mutually satisfactory under
the secret agreement concluded by them, while
Russian action respecting Port Arthur and
German action in regard to Kiau-Chau tallied at
every point.</p>

<p>The proceedings in regard to Kiau-Chau were
Hohenzollern to the last degree&mdash;arrogant and
theatrical.</p>

<p>Three German warships were dispatched to
China and they landed marines at Kiau-Chau
while preparations for sending out reinforcements
were hurried on in Germany.</p>

<p>The squadron was placed under the command of
the German Emperor's brother, Prince Henry of
Prussia, whom the Kaiser designated, in a farewell
speech at Kiel, as the "mailed fist" of
Germany.</p>

<p>The German Emperor thus furnished a pleasing
fancy for humoristic journalists and caricaturists,
for the comic side prevailed and the mission rocked
the world in the gentle throes of laughter rather
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
than stirred it with the tremulous quaking of
dread.</p>

<p>On arriving at Kiau-Chau with his squadron,
Prince Henry wrapped the mailed fist in a
parchment covering, demanding the "lease" of
the town and the neighbouring district to Germany
for a period of ninety-nine years; and, divining
that Germany could rely on the support of Russia,
the Court of Pekin had no option but to bow
to the inevitable, and the lease of the territory
demanded was signed on the 6th March, 1898.</p>

<p>The Shantung Peninsula, a maritime province
of China on the Yellow Sea, is the most densely
inhabited part of China, and is celebrated as the
native province of Confucius and therefore sacred
to both Chinese and Japanese followers of the
dictate of the sage's analects.</p>

<p>The peninsula is a mass of mountain ranges
which rise to a height of 5,000 feet. The ranges
are intersected by fertile valleys which provide
sustenance at a minimum expenditure of toil.</p>

<p>Kiau-Chau is a splendid harbour and, in regard
to Pekin, of great strategical importance. The
German occupation of the harbour and as much
of the surrounding territory as they could bring
under their influence was, they declared, only to
provide a gateway to China and an open door for
German trade.</p>

<p>The trade did not, however, progress under
German administration of the territory. There
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
were no means of transport, and until railways
could be constructed the port could only supply
and draw from its immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Only Germans frequented Kiau-Chau and trade
decreased, as the natives cordially disliked the
inquisitorial ways of the official system.</p>

<p>The chief value of Shantung is in its mineral
deposits&mdash;principally coal, and coal easily takes the
first place amongst articles of export. Iron ore,
gold, galena (lead and silver), and copper are
found in considerable quantities.</p>

<p>The principal agricultural products are wheat,
millet, Indian corn, pulse, arrowroot, castor-oil,
vegetables, and fruit.</p>

<p>Wax is a considerable article of trade, while
seri-culture (silk) forms an important industry.</p>

<p>Silkworms are fed on mulberry, oak, lettuce, or
vine leaves; and the nature and quality of the
silk depends upon the character of the food. The
worms fed on mulberry and lettuce leaves produce
the lighter forms of silk, those on vine leaves a silk
of a deeper yellow colour verging on red, while the
oak-leaf-fed worms produce the well-known pongee,
chifu or Shantung silks. This latter is not as fine
as the mulberry or lettuce silk but is of more practical
use and of better wear.</p>

<p>The soya bean, cultivated so extensively and
profitably in Japan, the oil cake made therefrom,
and cotton are also produced by the Chinese in
the Shantung province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The exports from Kiau-Chau, according to
Chinese statistics, amounted in 1912 to about
&pound;1,250,000; while the exports reached &pound;1,750,000.</p>

<p>Germany brought under her sway in the Shantung
Peninsula an area of about 120 square miles.</p>

<p>The German population in Kiau-Chau, exclusive
of troops, was only about 2,100 in 1913, but the
peninsula was strongly garrisoned. The Chinese
population centred about Tsingtau and amounted
to nearly 54,000.</p>

<p>Immediately after their occupation of the
Shantung province the Germans entered into
negotiations (which were probably conducted in
the usual Prussian way) with the Chinese authorities,
and a concession was granted for the continuation
of the Shantung railway to a junction with
the great cross-country railway Pekin-Hankau, the
German object being of course to establish a direct
Kiau-Chau-Pekin trade.</p>

<p>In 1914 a new service of steamships via the Suez
Canal from Hamburg to the American Pacific
coast was inaugurated, and the liners calling at
Tsingtau, in order to carry goods to the United
States and Canada without reshipment, provided
a fortnightly service for Tsingtau.</p>

<p>A German writer says: "The mountainous
neighbourhood of Tsingtau is, thanks to German
afforestation, beginning to get a different character.
Where formerly only rough open country was to be
seen, timber and orchards are filling the slopes.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
The Chinese <i>work voluntarily</i> for the Government,
and receive payment in seeds, shrubs, and trees for
their own property."</p>

<p>The Germans made every effort for the germanisation
of Shantung, and schools were established
where science and technical science were taught;
and the students, according to the same writer,
"first learned German and in this way became
messengers of German civilisation all over China,"
for which blessing China has not, seemingly,
exhibited any marked degree of gratitude.</p>

<p>Kiau-Chau and Tsingtau were fortified and made
as impregnable fortresses as modern science could
construct, and all German proceedings indicated
that any "ultimate retrocession to China" of the
province was extremely problematical.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the war of 1914 gave Japan an
opportunity of paying off to Germany both the
capital and accumulated interest of the score she
had held to Germany's debit ever since the latter's
unwarrantable intrusion into her sphere.</p>

<p>The capital consisted of an announcement in the
early stages of the war of Japan's intention to take
action to protect the general interests in the Far
East, "keeping especially in view the independence
and integrity of China," and in the delivery on the
15th August of an ultimatum to Germany.</p>

<p>The interest was provided by the ultimatum being
couched in almost identical terms with Germany's
ultimatum to Japan sixteen years previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is the text of the ultimatum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We consider it highly important and necessary
in the present situation to take measures to remove
the causes of all disturbance of peace in the Far
East, and to safeguard general interests as contemplated
in the agreement between Japan and Great
Britain.</p>

<p>"In order to secure firm and enduring peace in
Eastern Asia, the establishment of which is the
aim of the said agreement, the Imperial Japanese
Government sincerely believes it to be its duty to
give advice to the Imperial German Government to
carry out the following two propositions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(1) Withdraw immediately from Japanese and
Chinese waters the German men-of-war and armed
vessels of all kinds, and to disarm at once all those
which cannot be withdrawn.</p>

<p>"(2) To deliver, on a date not later than 15th
September, to the Imperial Japanese authorities
without condition or compensation the entire leased
territory of Kiau-Chau with a view to the eventual
restoration of the same to China.</p>

<p>"The Imperial Japanese Government announces
at the same time that in the event of its not receiving
by noon on 23rd August an answer from the
Imperial German Government signifying unconditional
acceptance of the above advice offered by
the Imperial Japanese Government, Japan will be
compelled to take such action as it may deem
necessary to meet the situation."</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The ultimatum caused a sensation in China, as
it was stated that China was fully of the intention
"eventually" to regain possession of Kiau-Chau
by her own resources. The Chinese Government
in perturbation expressed the opinion that the only
course for Germany was to cancel the lease of Kiau-Chau
and hand the territory back to China.</p>

<p>The United States of America intimated, as an
expression of their view, that the United States
would have been better pleased if the word "eventually"
in the ultimatum had been better defined.</p>

<p>On the 23rd August Japan declared war upon
Germany, and immediately proceeded, with the
assistance of British warships and men, to blockade
the harbour of Kiau-Chau and invest Tsingtau,
which was the key to the situation.</p>

<p>The German cruiser <i>Emden</i> was at Tsingtau on
the outbreak of war and got to sea before the
blockade.</p>

<p>The <i>Emden</i> had a short but by no means inglorious
career. Under her resourceful, gallant
and courteous Commander, Von M&uuml;ller, she
cruised the Bay of Bengal and destroyed British
shipping to the value of over &pound;1,000,000; she
bombarded Madras, causing appreciable damage,
and her final exploit of note was to steam boldly
into the British port of Penang, disguised by
rigging up a dummy extra funnel and flying the
Japanese flag, where she sank a Russian cruiser
and a French torpedo-boat destroyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>On 10th November, however, she arrived off
Cocos Islands, and while a landing party was busy
destroying the wireless and cable apparatus there
she was discovered by the Australian cruiser
H.M.A.S. <i>Sydney</i>, by whom she was engaged,
driven ashore and burnt.</p>

<p>The Shantung German possession made a
strenuous resistance, but after two months' investment
by land and blockade by sea, surrendered to
the joint British and Japanese force, and the dream
of a German Empire in the Far East was dissipated.</p>

<p>The fall of Tsingtau and Kiau-Chau was a
rending blow to German prestige in the East, and
its severity excited bitter comments on this extinguishment
of what was in German papers described
as "a shining testimony to German culture."</p>

<p>Poor old <i>kultur</i>! It has of late had many a heavy
burden to bear and is now entrusted with the final
destruction of Japan, for according to a leading
German paper: "The Japanese have assisted
England in destroying the most brilliant work of
German colonisation (save the mark!). England
will reap the harvest sown by her short-sighted
Government in a time not so far distant.</p>

<p>"Germany has lost Kiau-Chau, but not for ever;
and when eventually the time of reckoning arrives
then as unanimously as what is now a cry of pain
will a great shout of rejoicing ring through Germany&mdash;'Woe
to Nippon.'"</p>

<p class="pmb3">So both England and Japan had better look out.</p>
